The aim was “to highlight and counter the People’s Republic of China’s Military-Civil Fusion development strategy, which supports the modernisation goals of the People’s Liberation Army by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise acquired and developed by even those PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian entities.” Since the first such list was released in June last year, the U.S. has named some of China’s most well-known state-run firms, such as the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) that manufacture aircraft, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), the China Nuclear Engineering and Construction Corporation (CNEEC), and the telecommunications giant Huawei. The latest list, however, included a surprising name — Xiaomi, a 10-year-old smartphone and smart appliances manufacturer that has made a name for itself, both in China and abroad, for its cutting edge consumer products. The company immediately issued a statement, saying it “is not owned, controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military”.

However, questions remain as to why the National Guard were not deployed in force on the day of the mob attack. While the Guard in Washington was under the command of President Trump on the day of the Capitol attack, the orders to deploy are typically issued by the Secretary of the Army at the request of the Mayor. On that fateful day, other officials also weighed in on the use of the Guard, yet the details of how exactly that decision was made is the subject of debate. The most controversial aspect of the action taken on January 6 is that despite pleas to the Pentagon from Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, for National Guard boots on the ground, officials were quoted as saying that Director of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt said he could not recommend his boss, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, approve the request and that he did not like “the visual of a line of National Guard soldiers in front of the Capitol.” The manner in which these events played out warrants a closer look at the role of the National Guard as a protective force, the command-and-control structure that undergirds its operation, and the history of its deployment. Under U.S. statute, what is known as the ‘National Guard’ comprises both the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard. The former, however, is colloquially what is referred to as National Guard in the context of ground deployment, as in the case of the U.S. Capitol building attack. In this regard, the ‘Army National Guard’ refers to that part of the organised militia of the States of the U.S. as well as the country’s Territories, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. This cohort includes active and inactive troops, which together make up a land force that is trained and has statutorily appointed officers. The force is organised, armed, and equipped wholly or partly at Federal expense, and it is federally recognised. Defined broadly, the purpose of the National Guard is to serve as a unique element of the U.S. military, for both “community and country.” It is, therefore, tasked with equal responsibility to respond to domestic emergencies as it is to overseas combat missions, anti-drug initiatives, rescue and reconstruction missions and beyond.'], ['2021/01/16', 'news', 'Museveni wins 6th term amid allegations of rigged election - The Hindu Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni has won a sixth term in office, extending his 35-year rule after an election which took place under heavy security and an Internet blackout, and which his main rival said was marred by fraud and violence.

The company started serving the lab-grown meat on December 19 in the restaurant 1800. Lab-grown meat, also called in vitro meat and clean meat, is produced by “cellular agriculture” in bioreactors, starting from a small number of specialised stem cells collected using painless biopsy from animals.  For centuries, philosophers and preachers attempted to convert people to animal lovers, but slaughter of wild and domestic animals continued. Technology, more than empathy, has, however, come to the rescue of animals.  During the early 19th century, whale oil was the principal source of lighting around the world. Bedford, Massachusetts was recognised as the “city that lights the world”, because of its innumerable fleets that slaughtered thousands of whales in the high seas.

To come to the point, I decided to attend some crash programmes on time management. In one such session, the trainer, a person of good repute, enlightened us on the five Ps of time management — prioritise, plan, prepare, practise and perform. Everyone looked very impressed. It really amazes me that trainers invariably have a penchant for 3Rs, 4Hs, 5Zs and 6 what not! He quoted the entire galaxy of time-conscious success gurus, Stephen Covey, Ken Blanchard, Tom Peters, Shiv Khera, Norman Vincent Peale and whoever that mattered. Of the three sessions on time management that I attended, the last one I count the most precious. I counted every minute of it (you know even seconds!) because the fee I shelled out made me work out the amount per hour and as it seemed too exorbitant, I split it into minutes to salvage my conscience. The entire gamut of theories on the topic made me gape in wonder. How much time might have the theorists spent (I mean spent, not wasted as some pessimists may tend to put it!) on all these speculation! How could they manage their time for this enormous exercise away from work if they had any! One of the participants, the manger of a busy city bank, shared his time-imposed worry about having to attend numerous calls, enquiries that the callers, particularly NRIs, would only take from the manager’s mouth and visits of corporate officials for loans that they didn’t need at all; affix hundreds of mandatory signatures and paper work, do auditing rituals; and balance accounts which at times needed, in his own words, a more balancing act than tightrope walking — all this with just 24 hours available a day!

I have watched, heard and read so much about abuse of women that I consider it my mission to address the issues faced by women in light of my 35 years of experience as a teacher and mother, though I know that the subject has been debated, discussed and dissected worldwide by eminent personalities, experts, serious thinkers as well as victims. While physical abuse is the worst crime, I must remind people that emotional, intellectual and financial abuse follows a close second. In the wake of a series of these kind of offences that have been directed against women all across the globe, I shall redefine a few values, some old, some new, for women and young girls to face the challenges that keep cropping up in our dynamic society. Let us make sure that a woman arms herself with a skill-oriented education. Ideally, let the flaming passion of a career take centre stage early in her life. Let us include her in all family matters, both personal and legal. Let her be present when a deed is drawn, a business prospect is being discussed, a banking transaction is made or a will is being read. Let her listen to the advice of her parents, but let her gut instinct guide her life. Even if she makes wrong decisions, reassure her that there is nothing that cannot be sorted out, retracted, corrected or rectified. Failure of any sorts is just the means to another important lesson to be learnt in life. Nothing is so drastic that it cannot be dealt with — be it illness, death, losing the love of your life or failure to achieve your immediate goals. There are compensations that will turn out to be better choices. There are people who will pick you up and let you heal. There are miracles that will astound you. There are solutions that will spring up from the least expected quarters. Physical skills are a must for young girls. Swimming, biking, driving and exercising are essential accomplishments that have to be nurtured in a girl child. She should be taught to develop good self-esteem, and be trained to seek justice for herself and others who are less privileged. We must teach our daughters to love themselves as much as they learn to shower love on their partners and family. We must guide them to identify and choose friends who are steadfast in their love and loyalty.  The importance of financial security should be dinned into them from early childhood and parents should be role models in leading a non-extravagant life. Teach a girl the importance of saving up for a cause of her own or that of others. Financial independence is an absolute must as you may come across situations that you never have dreamt of. For instance, there are certain calamities that might take you by surprise — a sudden illness, a grievous injury, the loss of a young husband, a natural disaster or a divorce. A woman needs to contribute to a family’s finances too. Learn to live within a budget. Don’t spend on clothes, make-up, jewellery or fancy restaurants beyond a certain limit. These are ephemeral pleasures and make you want more and more. Instead, spend money and time on family, children, books and holidays. The mind needs to relax, imbibe new cultures, soak in myriad experiences and acquire fresh sensibilities.'], ['2021/01/17', 'opinion', 'Sports and sportsmanship - The Hindu Whenever my 14-year old son binge-watch YouTube videos on cricket, I am sure he had played the game that day and was unhappy with his performance.

So I would pick somebody relaxing in between games and I would tell him, “You know, when I have a bad time on the court, it affects the quality of my day.” But usually people won’t be forthcoming. The typical responses would be a feigned surprise (“Oh, is it!”), followed by the standard “I forget badminton the moment I step out of the court.” I was not ready to believe them.

I look back at primitive cultures celebrating this day, signifying the discovery of warmth and hope at the end of a severe winter. I too see flickers of expectation, but the long winter nights surrounding the earth bring no relief to a besieged land. The human race, it seems, has outrun its own pace with nowhere to go but hurtle to its own decline.  The severity of the early days of the pandemic begins to knock at my door again.

The dead are gone and sadly a dear one is missing on the daily evening walks. The tragedy and its numbing solitude, the cry of “the horror, the horror” in Conrad’s   resounds and foretells what is still to come. And yet I trudge towards the comforting idea of a balmy spring that awaits me, a sustaining vision comes that some day we all shall be free. But what good can come amid such a cataclysm? What good is anything at all? A parting kick at the end of the year dampens my spirits as I begin to anticipate returning to the old order and the joyful lightness of being. Though science struggles to be the saviour, the antagonist virus dexterously mutates its skill and weaponry before which hopes dwindle and antidotes stand redundant.  In this formidable assault on the human race, I see the manifestation of a bleak world allegorically reflecting the COVID-like unresponsiveness to the well-being of the multitudes.

A dovish liberal and the son of northern war refugees, Moon Jae-in had lobbied hard to help set up Mr. Trump’s three summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong -un, but their diplomacy stalemated over disagreements over easing crippling U.S.-led sanctions for the North’s disarmament. Mr. Biden has accused Mr. Trump of chasing the spectacle of summits rather than meaningful curbs on the North’s nuclear capabilities. North Korea has a history of staging weapons tests and other provocations to test new U.S. Presidents, and Mr. Kim vowed to strengthen his nuclear weapons programme in recent political speeches that were seen as aimed at pressuring the incoming Biden administration. The South Korean leader has been desperate to keep alive a positive atmosphere for dialogue in the face of Mr. Kim’s vows to further expand a nuclear and missile program that threatens Asian U.S. allies and the American homeland.']]\n",

One that I am sure many people are now going to miss. Having had the privilege of meeting her on several occasions — both in a professional capacity and private — I found that Dr. Shanta was someone whose gentle demeanour instantly put you at ease. Despite a packed schedule, she always took time out for interviews or to discuss how we could assist her several endeavours, something my father and I are eternally grateful for.  “It was destiny that took me to the Cancer Institute,” Dr. Shanta had told me in an interview. She spoke at length about the time when she joined the Institute in 1955 to support Dr. Krishnamurthi and his mother, Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy. “Ever since, there has been no looking back and I have been part and parcel of the Institute, in all its tribulations, vicissitudes, share its fears, hopes, successes and failures.” Not many know that at 93, the Ramon Magsaysay Award winner maintained a work schedule that was unimaginable for many much younger — doing her regular patient rounds, handling consultations, as well as the various tasks associated with the smooth running of the Institute. In another interview (for the Centre for Social Initiative and Management), Dr. Shanta spoke to me about how she belonged to an era when women professionals were few and she was determined to follow her dreams in the field of medicine. “I dreamt of being a trained physician, a doctor, from my school days. Back then, a majority of women settled down to a married household life and very few women took up a career. None of this appealed to me and my mother was very supportive of my choices,” she said. Strong-willed and generous, Dr. Shanta was always encouraging when approached for interviews, and provided tremendous support when I spent a year researching tobacco and its links with poverty.  She always spoke of how it was under the tutelage of Dr. Reddy — the first woman medical graduate of India — that she learnt how important it is to sustain an initiative and ensure that its performance speaks. “Back then, gathering support and donors was easy, as we had the backing of Dr. Muthulakshmi. As we grew, I have learnt that it is your transparency and effort that pays off. Your change should be measured by patient satisfaction and not on monetary grounds,” she said.

For the Houthis in northern Yemen, it was a tipping point. What started as a religious revivalist movement aimed at restoring the fading glory of the Zaydi sect of Islam, the Houthis, under the leadership of Hussein al-Houthi, were turning political. When the second intifada broke out in the Palestinian territories in 2000, the Houthis staged solidarity protests. They mobilised supporters against the U.S.’s war on Afghanistan in 2001. After the Iraq war, they adopted a new slogan, “Death to America, death to Israel, curse upon the Jews, victory to Islam”. Not many had foreseen back then that this tiny group of tribesmen from the Marran Mountains of the northern province Sa’dah would grow into the most powerful rebel war machine in Yemen and, within little over a decade, capture the capital Sana’a and establish their rule over much of the country.  For the past six years, the Houthis have been controlling Sana’a, while attempts to dislodge them, including a Saudi-led military intervention, failed to meet their goals. The success story of the Houthis is also the story of one of the worst humanitarian crises of our times. The Saudi military intervention, the Houthi resistance and a separatist movement in the south have collectively turned Yemen into a humanitarian catastrophe. And then, there is Al-Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula, exploiting the lawlessness and expanding its operations. Making matters worse, the administration of Donald Trump in the U.S. designated the Houthis a ‘terrorist organisation’ in its final days in office. This is expected to make providing aid to the Houthi-held territories and finding an eventual political solution to the crisis difficult. The ball is now in U.S. President Joe Biden’s court. The roots of the Houthi movement can be traced to “Believing Youth” (Muntada al-Shahabal-Mu’min), a Zaydi revivalist group founded by Hussein al-Houthi and his father, Badr al-Din al-Houthi, in the early 1990s. Badr al-Din was an influential Zaydi cleric in northern Yemen. Inspired by the Iranian revolution of 1979 and the rise of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon in the 1980s, Badr al-Din and his sons started building vast social and religious networks among the Zaydis of Yemen, who make up roughly one-third of the Sunni-majority country population. The Zaydis are named after Zayd Bin Ali, the great grandson of Imam Ali, Prophet Mohammed’s cousin and son-in-law who both Shias and Zaydis revere. Zayd Bin Ali had led a revolt against the Ummayad Caliphate in the eighth century. He was killed, but his martyrdom led to the rise of the Zaydi sect. While the Zaydis are seen part of the Shia branch of Islam, both in terms of theology and practice they are different from the ‘Twelver’ Shias of Iran, Iraq and Lebanon. For centuries, the Zaydis were a powerful sect within Yemen. In the 16th century, they established an imamate and in the 17th, they ousted the Ottomans from Yemen. The imamate went into decline and got fractured in the 19th century, faced with challenges from repeated attacks from the Ottomans and the rising influence of Wahhabism in Arabia. After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1918, the Zaydis, once again, consolidated power in northern Yemen and established the Mutawakkilite Kingdom. This lasted till 1962 when the Egypt-backed republicans overthrew the monarchy. The royalists would withdraw to the northern mountains and start guerilla attacks with support from Saudi Arabia. But by 1967, their rebellion would fail, bringing an end to the era of Zaydi dominance in Yemen. When Badr al-Din al-Houthi and his son Hussein launched Believing Youth, the plan was to reorganise the Zaydi minority, like the Hezbollah organised Shias of southern Lebanon. But when the movement turned political and started attacking the “corrupt” regime of Ali Abdullah Saleh and his support for the U.S.’s war on terror, it became a thorn on Saleh’s side. They called themselves Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), mobilised tribesmen in the north against the government and chanted the “Death to America” slogans. In 2004, Saleh’s government issued an arrest warrant against Hussein al-Houthi. He resisted the arrest, starting an insurgency. In September, the government troops attacked the rebels and killed Hussein. Since then, the government launched multiple military campaigns in Sa’dah, the Zaydi stronghold, to end the resistance, which was locally called the Houthis movement, after their “martyred” leader. But the government’s heavy hand backfired. It only strengthened the Houthis, who, by 2010 when a ceasefire was reached, had captured Sa’dah from the government troops.'], ['2021/01/23', 'news', 'Taiwan reports Chinese air incursions - The Hindu Intrusive movement: A Chinese H-6K bomber patrolling the islands in the South China Sea, in this file photo.\\n\\xa0 | Photo Credit:    Eight Chinese bomber planes and four fighter jets entered the southwestern corner of Taiwan’s air defence identification zone on Saturday, and Taiwan’s Air Force deployed missiles to “monitor” the incursion, the island’s Defence Ministry said.

We had a detailed discussion with the patient and her two daughters and son about the pros and cons of surgery vs non-operative treatment.

She had become breathless in the midnight, and though the crash team of doctors started resuscitation within five minutes, she died by the time I reached the hospital.

Inundation of this kind is a recurrent issue for residents, who believe that the solution to this problem lies in the construction of stormwater drains (SWDs) in Kaliamman Koil Street.

These models can help hospitals optimise their resources. The first model can predict a patient’s deterioration based on a single X-ray. The second one can recognise a patient’s condition with a sequence of X-rays. This model can predict up to four days in advance whether a patient may need more intensive care.

The commander, Manghal Bagh, led an outlawed militant group called Lashkar-e-Islam, or Army of Islam. The group had frequently targeted Pakistani troops in the country’s northwest bordering Afghanistan until the mid-2010s, when Pakistan cleared the region of militants. Bagh had been on the run until his death on Thursday in Afghanistan’s eastern Nangarhar province, which was announced by provincial governor Ziaulhaq Amarkhil in a brief statement on Twitter. Amarkhil did not say who was responsible for the roadside bomb that killed Bagh and his two companions, but said the militant leader had been involved in attacks in Afghanistan. Washington announced the bounty for Bagh in 2018 over his alleged terrorist activities. Bagh and his group had a strong presence in northwest Pakistan’s Tirah Valley until military operations cleared the mountainous region of militants, including the Pakistani Taliban, remnants of al-Qaida and other groups. Since then, it was believed that Bagh was hiding in neighboring Afghanistan. Northwest Pakistan still sees sporadic attacks, mainly targeting security forces. Earlier this month, Pakistan’s military said it had nearly completed a fence along the border with Afghanistan, which it says is necessary to prevent militant attacks from both sides of the 2,611km (1,622-mile) border, known as the Durand Line.

Investors who take such positions do so by selling borrowed stock at the prevailing market price. The logic is: when the price falls, they can buy it at that lower price, thereby making a profit. They would then be able to return the stock to those who owned it in the first place. But what if the price doesn’t fall but, instead, climbs and keeps climbing? That means trouble.

Fearless and United Guards, styled as FAU-G is inspired by the real lives that guard our borders in the Galwan Valley, a sub-zero inhospitable place. nCore Games takes time to craft an interesting story around a surviving member of FAU-G, an elite unit of Indian soldiers who have been taken prisoner by Chinese forces. You play as this lone warrior, taking the fight against the enemy to save your squad against all odds.  Clearly, the story and setting does twang that patriotic bone pretty well. At this moment the Battle Royale mode as well as a Deathmatch Mode tantalise you from beneath their disabled states.

Taking into consideration the ‘no open fire allowed’ agreement between India and China from November 1996, this is all about hand-to-hand combat with a lot of weapons thrown into the mix.

Li Ziqi (pronounced zi-chee) has, since uploading her first YouTube video in August 2017, become an unlikely social media phenomenon. For the uninitiated, her slickly produced videos show a slice of life in the Chinese countryside, taking viewers into a world of idyllic calm that offers a sharp contrast to fast-paced urban life. The videos are shot painstakingly with a high quality of production, showing Ms. Li doing everything from chopping firewood to climbing trees to pick fruit, all intended to convey a sense of therapeutic calm, with the kind of aesthetic one usually finds in online meditation videos. Her most popular video so far, which has 83 million views, is a case in point. Titled “Peanut and melon seeds, dried meat, dried fruit, snowflake cake”, it begins with Ms. Li searching the forest floor, with a basket strapped to her back, sifting through leaves to find chestnuts. She picks oranges and apples from trees, and strolls through fields in the company of her pet lamb and puppies. She then uses traditional cooking methods — she eschews all modern appliances — to make a variety of snacks and popcorn. Her videos go beyond cooking. Ms. Li is a one-woman army, making bamboo crafts and, as she showed in her first YouTube video in August 2017, a dress using grape skin. Ms. Li’s is an unlikely success story. Born in Mianyang, a city in southwestern Sichuan province, she grew up with her father after her parents separated. He passed away when she was six, leaving her in the care of her grandparents. She now lives with her grandmother, who makes a regular appearance in her videos and is the main benefactor of Ms. Li’s culinary skills. She dropped out of high school and tried odd jobs in the city from waitressing to working as a DJ in a bar. Unable to find work, she moved back to the countryside and opened an online clothing store. Her first videos were shot only on her phone, a far cry from today’s elaborately produced videos with a videographer assisting her full-time. Her global success has now spurred other rural Chinese celebrity success stories.

On August 26, 1988, half-a-million people showed up at the capital’s famous Shwedagon Pagoda, to listen to her. “I could not, as my father’s daughter, remain indifferent to all that is going on,” she told the crowd, in a speech that would change not just her destiny but also that of her country. “This national crisis could in fact be called the second struggle for national independence.” She couldn’t stop the military. Within a month, a new junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), would take over. But the struggle she launched would never cease. As the Generals were trying to regain control, Ms. Suu Kyi helped found the National League for Democracy (NLD), the most potent political rival to the military till date. On February 1 this year, when the military staged another coup preventing the new Parliament, elected in the November 8, 2020 election, from holding its first session, the soldiers naturally went after almost all the top leaders of the NLD, including Ms. Suu Kyi and President Win Myint.  The party was founded on September 27, 1988, a week after the SPDC was formed. Tin Oo, a former Commander-in-Chief of the Burmese military who was forced to retire and jailed, and Aung Shwe, a former Brigadier-General, joined hands with Ms. Suu Kyi. Mr. Tin Oo was the first president of the party, while Ms. Suu Kyi served as the general secretary for years. The NLD, a liberal, social democratic party, demanded the junta give up power and initiate the country’s transition to democracy. The junta detained Ms. Suu Kyi, Mr. Tin Oo and other NLD leaders in response. But under domestic and international pressure, the SPDC agreed to hold polls in 1990. The NLD swept the polls, winning roughly 58% of the popular vote (382 seats in the 492-member Assembly), while the National Unity Party, a proxy of the military, won only 10 seats.

In the absence of waiting and cloak rooms, passengers coming from across the State are left stranded while they search for lodging facility during night hours, putting them, especially women and children and elderly, at risk .  Moreover, due to dearth of shelters, people are exposed to rain and sun and are forced to stand in the open till they board buses. Senior citizens and physically challenged have no means to sit down and wait for the buses. As a result of poorly maintained toilets, a stench hangs in the air.

More than a year ago, I finished my treatment and was declared a cancer survivor. Many things seem surreal to me these days. The very fact that I am still alive and kicking makes me shake my head in disbelief. I try to understand what exactly a cancer survivor’s life is all about. I think it is something like this — you have an enemy right by your side day in and day out. He is always striving to do away with you. You just have no way of learning his characteristics to make your plans to face him, but you have to befriend him in such a way that he forgets his purpose, well at least for some time! Life becomes demarcated as BC and AC (before cancer and after cancer). You learn very soon that life can never be the same again, neither for you nor for your family. Pushed to your limits, you always become smart and efficient. Same thing happens for a cancer survivor also. Faced with the reality of death, you start cherishing life, every facet of it. You equip yourself to face eventualities, making you stronger and stronger that you are surprised at your own strength. Like all things in life, I believe that this phase of my life also has a bright side to it. I have become brutally aware of the mechanical life I had been leading, totally neglecting my health. I prefer to call myself a catcher of sunshine these days. I am aware or conscious of every single moment of my life. My surgery table has become a bodhi tree for me. Now I can easily strike a rapport with all the elements of this life and the earth around me. Living life one day at a time liberates me no end. Sparrows, butterflies, foggy mountains, morning green tea, circumlocutory kolams that I draw in the mornings, unending music that I listen to and the meals that I prepare with no hurry all bring joy to me. Many changes have crept into my life. A few books did teach me certain good things — one of them is Anticancer: A new way of life by David Servan-Schreiber. He strongly advocates every cancer survivor to create a relationship with our bodies that stimulates the immune system. Understanding and healing the psychological wounds that feed cancer is very important. Lifestyle changes, especially eating organic food that prevent and actively fight tumours and cutting back on cancer promoters, are very important. Our mental health is as important as our physical health. A holistic approach helps me a lot. It is very important to discard negative thoughts. You can include negative'], ['2021/02/07', 'opinion', 'Saving the precious drops - The Hindu The ever-shrinking sources of fresh water have spelled misery for most big cities. An acute water shortage bringing daily life to a standstill in a big metropolitan city such as Chennai in recent times brought out the harsh reality. In Jaipur, there are billboards and adverts every few metres on the roads about the preciousness of water and how we must be cautious about its use, as every drop counts. It is a powerful message — one that makes you ponder about it and drives a sense of responsibility in the residents and visitors alike. An admirably simple initiative, it can be adopted by every city to drive the message home. More than water conservation, it is water recycling that is the absolute need of the hour. Rainwater harvesting is a solid step towards water harvesting, but may not be feasible for everyone and is simply not enough. Many cities have mandatory requirements of having rainwater harvesting systems to be incorporated in the building designs, whether a row house or apartment complex, without which building plans are not sanctioned. However, it exists merely on paper. In reality, these rainwater harvesting systems are not in use or are under (permanent) maintenance. The unaware urban populace that resides in such multi-storey apartment complexes, is content by the rainwater harvesting systems in place by the building complex and continues wasteful expenditure of the already limited source of freshwater. Water is already rationed by many municipalities. But for a change to occur, we must minutely look at what each household can adopt in their routine lifestyle. We can start by taking a look at the things we do in our kitchens. We wash grains, vegetables and pulses before we cook. For example, we wash rice a minimum of three times before cooking. All that water is going down the drain. We are wasting many precious litres of water every day in this manner, without realising that this water can be reused to bring down our total consumption of freshwater in a day. Storing the water that we discard after washing rice, pulses and vegetables, you will notice that we easily use an average of two buckets of freshwater for this purpose alone. This water, if left undisturbed for 30 minutes, will undergo sedimentation, where the particle impurities will settle down and water will be clear to reuse. You can use this to water your plants, wash your vehicles, windows, floors, dusting sponges, floor mops and kitchen rags or flushing toilet. Those of us who have RO water purifiers at home, know that it throws out more water than its output. A simple bucket collection method will make you realise just how much water goes waste every day in this manner (easily amounting to an average of three buckets for a four-member family). While this water is unfit for watering your plants or washing your kitchen rags or floor mops (very hard water does not lather with soap and hence cannot clean clothes), it can be used (instead of fresh tap water) to soak our used utensils, to aid in easy cleaning after cooking. For example, your teapot, tea mugs, plates, pressure cooker, rice cooker, other pots and pans. Use this water to wash the floor, balcony and vehicle. It can also be used to flush your toilet.'], ['2021/02/07', 'opinion', 'Being an observer - The Hindu The first time I became an observer, in its literal sense, was nearly 45 years ago. As a young armoured corps officer, during the field firing of our regiment, at the Mahajan ranges in Rajasthan, I was appointed an observer. My job was to sit on a flank and observe the target with binoculars, when a tank fired. Having observed the shot, I had to report to the control, on a radio set, whether it was a hit or a miss. It was to enable them to make the necessary corrections so that the gun could be zeroed in on the target. Today at 67, I am an observer of a different kind. I am an observer of my thoughts. Thoughts are like a monkey which keep jumping in our mind continuously. Like a CD, they keep playing and replaying. Negative, unpleasant thoughts based on fear, hurt and bad memories play more often and frequently. COVID-19 has made it even worse. The mind is cluttered with these thoughts, and we are confused. I was no better till I became the squadron commander. I would lose my temper or become impatient when someone behaved not to my liking. Quite often, my actions would be based on impulsive thoughts, resulting in unwise and stressful decisions. In such situations, the mind tends to control you, and you become its slave. The mind is hardly relaxed and you suffer tension, and lack of sleep. As a result, you become irritable, and the performance level goes down. Slowly, with practice and pranayama and the habit of good reading and writing, one developed the skill of looking within — introspection. That also enabled me to watch my mind, and control the thoughts. I started analysing my actions and would soon come to know whether I was wrong or right. Our conscience tells us so. In case wrong, I would not hesitate to say ‘sorry’ to the person whom I had caused the hurt. That would put me at ease, as also remove bitterness or the communication gap with fellow beings. I tried to keep my mind light and open. A commanding officer has to be calm and centred, then alone he can command troops well. He will inspire troops to high motivation and morale, with minimum cases of suicide and fratricide. The habit of introspection has given me a good insight and control over my mind. Today, as a veteran, I can watch my thoughts dispassionately and control the “monkey” within, thereby not reacting impulsively. When someone says or does something unreasonable, one analyses the reason for that person’s behaviour, and ignore the negativity. It is his or her problem. Why should we make our mind a “garbage bin” for others’ negative thoughts. We cannot and need not control others. But definitely, we can control our own thoughts and actions. A simple principle in life can make our life healthy and fruitful — negativity stay out, positivity please come in.

For businesses, it is a nimble way to bring down the cost, improve the quality, and survive the competition. For us, it is a shrewd way to save money and enjoy all the luxuries it offers. Would this paradigm shift make the world a better place for all of us? To begin with, homes are becoming smart. Especially after COVID-19, many of us are working from home. This has led to a huge market for smart widgets that make our homes comfy to live in and save on energy at the same time. For example — smart thermostats, smart lights, smart switches, smart refrigerators, smart garage door openers, smart security cameras, smart locks, smart smoke detectors, smart TVs, smart entertainment systems, smart laundry machines, smart dish-washing machines, smart energy meters, smart water meters, smart gas meters, and so forth. You name it, we have it. These smart doohickeys are flooding the market for a reason. They save us energy and make our lives a lot easier in this stress-filled professional world. The global smart home market is estimated to be about $70 billion and is expected to grow over $300 billion by 2025. Collaterally, smart homes are the building blocks of smart cities. Smart cities save tons of money to city administrations. They save on resources such as power, gas, and water. Smart city governments are priding themselves in their excellent services to their citizens. Especially during the pandemic, smart cities have responded very well to emergencies. The coordination between hospitals, ambulatory serves, and various other city services is impeccable. Smart hospitals that were overloaded with COVID-19 patients managed their resources efficiently. Out of 600 global cities that are yet to go smart, more than 100 have officially been declared smart! And that is a feather in their cap! The market size of global smart city transformation is expected to grow from $400 billion in 2020 to about $800 billion by 2025. In the world of healthcare, there has never been a better time than now. Telemedicine is on the rise because of COVID-19 scare. No one wants to visit hospitals for simple ailments. Today for simple aches, you can get diagnosed online and the medications would arrive at your door. You don’t have to get out of your bed! The world can’t be any better!

It also found that most Indian Americans oppose government crackdowns on the media and the use of police force on peaceful protesters.  Respondents are also more liberal on U.S. issues while holding more conservative positions on Indian matters. The survey report, “How Do Indian Americans View India? Results from the 2020 Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS),” is based on the 2020 Indian American Attitudes Survey of 1,200 Indian American adults (+/- 2.8 % margin of error) from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Johns Hopkins-SAIS, and the University of Pennsylvania in partnership with YouGov. The survey report, co-authored by Sumitra Badrinathan, Devesh Kapur and Milan Vaishnav, is the second of a set of two studies of the political attitudes of Indian Americans done by the IAAS. Thirty nine per cent of Indian Americans feel India is moving in the wrong direction, while 36% feel it is on the right track. As a comparator, 67% of the IAAS respondents felt the U.S. was on the wrong track (data were collected in September 2020). A larger share of Indian Americans born outside America felt that India was on the right track. Most (65%) Indian Americans either strongly or somewhat oppose the use of police force against individuals peacefully opposing the governments citizenship laws (CAA and NRC). Most (69%) also oppose the government’s use of defamation and sedition laws to silence reporters critical of the Modi administration. However, over half support the NRC (55%) and a wafer thin majority that supports the CAA (51%). Indian American views on issues also vary according to context and the results are indicative of respondents taking more liberal positions in the U.S. context. Studying positions across similar issues in the India and U.S. contexts, the survey finds that generally 90% of Indian Americans support the notion of equal treatment of people belonging to different religions but this number is 60% for a specific U.S. context (the ‘Muslim ban’ ) and drops further to 49% in the Indian context (CAA).'], ['2021/02/09', 'news', 'UN chief reaches out to Asian leaders to call for collective action for reversal of coup in Myanmar - The Hindu In this file photo the United Nations logo is seen at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.\\n\\xa0 | Photo Credit:     Reiterating his concern over the situation in Myanmar, United Nations (UN) Secretary General Antonio Guterres has been reaching out to regional leaders in Asia to call for collective and bilateral action to create conditions for the recent military coup in the country to be reversed, the UN chief’s spokesperson has said.

Earlier this month, Tesla founder Elon Musk made his début on the platform. And this week, China blocked Clubhouse but not before a rare few days of uncensored conversations on topics it considers touchy.  At a time when much of the social media conversation is driven by pithy text updates, filtered photos, snappy videos, and memes, the San Francisco-based Clubhouse app is centred around people talking real-time, no cameras on. “Voice is so universal but in the world of social networking, it’s relatively new,” Paul Davison, Clubhouse’s co-founder, told CNBC recently. Giants Facebook and Twitter are reportedly coming up with their own products to take on Clubhouse. You can access Clubhouse only on an Apple mobile device, as of now, and you can sign in only if you have been invited by an existing user. Once inside the app, what you see are ‘rooms’, lots and lots of them. Each ‘room’ is a space where a conversation is happening. You can enter one, listen in, even participate if allowed. It is much like having a wide choice of radio channels but here you can take part too. Also, you can even start a ‘room’ of your own.

Mr. Davison built a location-based app called Highlight, using which users could connect over common interests. He sold it to Pinterest eventually. Mr. Seth, a former Google engineer, co-founded a company called Memry Labs, which was into building social applications. He sold Memry to Opendoor. Then, in 2019, they say in the Clubhouse blog, “we decided to give social apps one last try”.  Coming into the scene much after the disruptive new conversational spaces brought forth by the first generation of social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, Clubhouse may not operate by the playbook of its predecessors. Mr. Davison said in the CNBC interview that “the focus is on authentic human connection and dialogue rather than likes or followers”. There is also no record of Clubhouse conversations to come back to. If you miss them once, you miss them forever. Mr. Davison likens the experience on the app to the experience of going to a conference, where the keynote sessions are big and reach a lot of people but there are also smaller break-out sessions and hallway conversations that are private. The choice of what it should be rests with the person who starts these conversations. Not everything is for everyone. It can be a private conversation that one has with one more person, much like a phone conversation, or something that reaches many, many people, as Mr. Musk’s conversation with the CEO of online brokerage Robinhood did. The 5,000-limit per ‘room’ was hit pretty soon, but this conversation was allowed to overflow into other ‘rooms’.'], ['2021/02/13', 'news', \"Biden wants to close Guantanamo Bay prison - The Hindu  U.S. President Joe Biden wants to close the Guantanamo Bay prison for terror suspects before the end of his term, the White House said on Friday, echoing an unfulfilled campaign promise from Barack Obama’s administration.

Growing up, I have wondered if this belief was too naïve and wishy-washy. After all, one could adjudge a person’s capacity in multiple ways: competitions, aptitude tests, grade sheets. But the peril of labelling children and categorising them, of reducing their persona to a few observable capabilities, is that it clips their wings early on. For those unrecognised, it leaves an indelible mark on their self-belief and that affects how they function as adults. Talent recognition is important but what children truly need is support and encouragement, not just to harness their potential but to discover them in the first place, and schools and higher educational institutions play a pivotal role in providing such a conducive learning space.  The adult world, however, told me that life was a battle, and that we cannot all be winners. Adults, even adolescents, always have their guard up, ready to defend their claim to championship. Nobody wants to go home empty-handed, without the trophy, the medal and a pat on the back. This feverish insistence on being \"achievers\", desperately avoiding imminent failure or worse, mediocrity, is perhaps at its most dazzling display on LinkedIn profiles. It is hard to be raised in a developing, ambitious country and not hear the phrase \"Life is a race\" repeatedly.  Higher educational institutions only cement this notion further by setting incredibly high standards for admissions. The \"race mentality\" extends after entering such institutions and presumably carries well into one’s career. There is little scope for learning in dictatorial institutions that promote a blinkered mindset of grades and jobs. Even outside academic institutions, the belief of \"all-or-nothing\" has seeped well into our psyches. Nobody becomes a Van Gogh overnight and yet, we lay emphasis on excellence even while pursuing hobbies. In an acutely stressful, confined environment, stars are not born; they are crushed as they succumb to the weight of expectations.  Years after leaving school, as I observe the millennials and GenZ struggle to hold on to their self-worth in the race to the finish, quickly discarding any new-found passion that they don’t immediately shine at, my heart goes back to what the cynic in me long discarded, the belief that echoed within my school walls: every person brings something unique to the table and the world is big enough for everybody.  divyavenkattu@gmail.com'], ['2021/02/14', 'opinion', 'What comes next? - The Hindu Writing a letter using pen and paper is an experience to remember, which, however, is soon becoming a thing of the past. Letters not only convey information but also have an emotional and personal touch. Delivering letters take time, not instantaneous as an e-mail.  But those days, people never thought of the delay and eagerly awaited the postman who rode a bicycle with mails and money orders. There were mainly three modes of communications then: letters, telegrams and telephones.  Telephones were rare, generally possessed only by the rich and business people. Owning a telephone was a symbol of pride. For any important conversations, common people depended on telephones at post offices. A messenger from the receiving-end post office would intimate the called party about the call. He or she would have to go to the post office to take the call. The whole process would take a few hours.  When our SSLC (old pattern 11th standard) public examination mark sheets were computerised for the first time, teachers used to threaten us that if we did any mischief, we would be punished by the computers with wrong mark entries. At that time, we were under the wrong notion that computers could do mistakes. We did not know that it works according to the program and never makes any mistake or mischief by itself.  Telegraphic messages were generally used for emergency situations such as serious health conditions or death. The words used were crisp and to the point. As time passed on, telephones and telegrams slowly took a back seat. On July 14, 2013, the 163-year-old telegram service came to an end.  With technological growth, landline telephones were made available for the public based on prior registration. Public telephone booths mushroomed on the roads. The era of mobile phones made tremendous impact on the public. I remember my first mobile phone which was a quarter of the size of a brick. Interestingly, on the first day I used a mobile phone, it started ringing when I was teaching in a classroom. Embarrassed by the unceremonious sound, I picked it up, without practically knowing which button to press, though I was instructed how to attend a call. Luckily, a student came to my rescue. '], ['2021/02/14', 'opinion', 'Budgets of yesteryear - The Hindu During Nirmala Seetharaman’s Budget speech in the Lok Sabha on February 1, amid the customary thumping of desks, my heart missed a beat when the TV screen flashed relief for those above 75 years of age from the age-old harassment of having to file the income tax return (ITR). In my experience, it is not a single-shot epidemic that visits a senior citizen once in a year; it is something that one has to live with right round the year, keeping track of various items of income and expenditure. But the euphoria soon evaporated when the small print of the red herring was laid bare. However, later the realisation dawned upon me that at least my wife will be spared the year-end recurrent visits to the bank to ensure that the TDS on fixed deposit interest income had been uploaded to get reflected in Form 26AS. When I look back in time, I recall that during the first few years of my service, I did not face the hassle of having to file a formal income tax return, which now I have been denied even after crossing the momentous milestone of 75 years, by a quirk of fate. The accounts branch used to disburse my take-home salary in cash after all the deductions. I only ever used to be asked to sign a certificate that there were no other sources of income and the rest was left to the authorities to decide. I did not, in effect, have to file the year-end tax return. Additionally, I reluctantly invested ₹25 or thereabouts in the statutory provident fund, on which the current Budget proposals have imposed a supposedly unconscionable ceiling. With the money in hand being just about adequate to meet our bare necessities, I never bothered about the budget, which used to be presented at 5 p.m. on the last day of February then. I am sure, many similarly placed individuals today, with no tax to pay or surplus to invest, are equally unconcerned about the portmanteau. My family and I were quite happy then, though the salary did not stretch to cover the whole month, especially the last week of the month when we used to move around with our piggy bank (in the shape of a used oblong powder box) in tow, in which the change received back from sundry purchases used to be stored. Memories of those \"no-return\" days inevitably go back to the period when my wife joined me a few months after our marriage in Nizamabad district, now in Telangana, where I was being trained. One of the reminiscences, permanently etched in our memory, pertains to my first official house assistant.  Before her arrival, his main duties were confined to sprucing up my sparsely furnished living room, which was part of the District Collector’s residential complex, and getting me my \"daily bread\" and monthly quota of cigarettes. When she came into the picture, he was required to get the groceries and vegetables with the money she gave him, while I continued to requisition my cigarettes with his assistance. One day, he took a significant amount of money from both of us for our respective requirements and disappeared. Soon enough, we came to know that the wife of the gardener of the Collector was also missing. My personal assistant had eloped with her, which created an unsavoury, though temporary, hierarchical rift. The wife of my assistant and the husband of the gardener approached us for succour, which, to our eternal regret, we were unable to provide or even vaguely suggest the obvious option available.']]\n",

We advise the same, do not give into temptation; buy from an authorised seller. The PS5 is a pretty add-on for your home’s display thanks to the futuristic blue, white and yellow lights varying with its mode. You can choose which orientation to place the unit, attaching the base accordingly so that the curvatures of the design do not have it tilting awkwardly. The attachable base is also helpful in keeping the off-white surfaces of the console scuff-free.  Reviewing the base console edition, it comes with the comfortably ergonomic DualSense controller.

Sumathra has seen many sessions of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva come and go. Half a dozen resolutions on Sri Lanka have been adopted since, but she is no closer to finding out where he is.  Ahead of the 46th session of the Council beginning next week, the Sri Lankan government, Tamil polity, civil society, and diaspora groups are frantically lobbying member countries, hoping for different outcomes. But Ms. Sumathra is not waiting with bated breath. “We are used like trophies every time, and nothing that comes out of these sessions alters our reality,” she says.  She was seated at a concrete shelter by the sea, shining in a lavish blue-green shade under the afternoon sun, last weekend. Along with her are groups of women, from both the Tamil and Muslim community residing in the district, all gathered for a campaign on caring better for the environment.  “Families of forcibly disappeared persons have been agitating since the war ended [in 2009], but some of our politicians and diaspora organisations have split our struggle. Today, we are all in different groups with no prospect for truth or justice,” says the 36-year-old.  So far, none of the past UN resolutions or governmental mechanisms has delivered a convincing outcome for many like her. Although the UN human rights chief, in her latest Sri Lanka report, called for an International Criminal Court probe into alleged war crimes committed by different warring actors, as well as sanctions, Ms. Sumathra is unable to feel hopeful. The new, likely contested, resolution in the coming session is “just another” one, in her view. Sri Lanka’s long civil war played out across the Tamil-majority north and east, but Mullaitivu bore the brunt of its gruesome end. According to UN estimates, some 40,000 civilians were trapped and killed in the final battle between the armed forces and the separatist LTTE, at the Nandikadal lagoon here in May 2009.

Where necessary and appropriate, I will back primary rivals who espouse Making America Great Again and our policy of America First,” he said. Mr. McConnell has been in the news of late, having provoked the ire of both Democrats and Republicans. The Democrats criticised him for his apparent expediency and his inconsistent positions on the Trump impeachment trial and his view on Mr. Trump’s role in the Capitol attack of January 6. Mr. Trump attacked him for the same thing. Mr. McConnell, who had voted on February 13 to acquit the former President for inciting an insurrection, told the Senate that very same Saturday afternoon that there was “no question” that Mr. Trump was “practically and morally responsible” for provoking the Capitol attack.

It would shock a status quoist, cynically manipulative system, and turn public attention to the world’s biggest problems: climate change and biodiversity loss. The vision of its small group of founders led by Roger Hallam, an organic farmer-turned-researcher of civil disobedience at King’s College, London, and Gail Bradbrook, a molecular biology scholar from Yorkshire who had launched her activism in the Occupy movement after the 2008 financial crisis, draws heavily from the U.S. civil rights struggle and Gandhian civil disobedience. The two worked to create an environmental movement that would use disruptive, non-violent methods in the climate and biodiversity struggle. It immediately appeared to resonate with common citizens, hundreds of whom were ready to court arrest in street protests. “We refuse to bequeath a dying planet to future generations by failing to act now. We act in peace, with ferocious love of these lands in our hearts. We act on behalf of life,” says the Declaration of Rebellion document of the movement. When it formally made the declaration on October 31, 2018, XR, as it has come to be known, expected a couple of hundred people to gather at Westminster outside the British Parliament, but the event attracted a thousand. Since then, its logo of an hourglass within a circle has become familiar globally. The high visibility protests carried out by XR groups — three major ones so far — often involve dramatic scenes staged by brightly costumed activists to drive home the message of climate ruin. The movement has three primary demands: all governments ‘Tell the Truth’ about the climate crisis and the mass extinction of species, commit themselves to act on net zero carbon emissions by 2025, and create citizens’ assemblies that will advise them on a just transition. Yet, the group also does not look to the government to solve the world’s problems. It favours people collectively creating the structures to challenge power, eliminating the bias of the voice of the rich and the powerful. Among the core concerns it pursues are “decent healthcare, education, social care and housing, clean energy production, and protections in law to prevent ecocide.” Like any good open source project, the U.K. kernel produced by XR has been embraced by activists abroad, who get the freedom to build upon it. A strategy document released by XR last year titled “Power Together” says it is now present in 75 countries. Legal systems and political tolerance levels for protest differ around the world, inviting prosecutions and harsh crackdowns. Yet, XR has inspired groups of citizens, particularly the youth, and professionals in different fields to start local branches. The India website of XR lists 14 local groups, ranging from Bengaluru and Delhi to Rajasthan and Guwahati. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, hobbled the climate protests in many places around the world.  Initially seen as nothing more than an outcrop of the environmental fringe made up of small groups of straggler activists, XR moved to the mainstream as it linked up with activists such as Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future campaign she inspired and acquired a wider base of supporters connected with the arts, sciences, law, and finance.

So in these times, cycling has proved to be a safe way to maintain social distance and come out of that cocoon of “stay at home”.

The gush of chill winds wakes up the mind to a fresh start to the day. Pedalling helps the body fall in sync with the mind and the overall feel is quite refreshing. Cycling can be said to be the best mode to be with nature. It teaches an important lesson that it is the path rather than the destination which holds more value. Reaching a destination and enjoying what is waiting for us is as important as how we travel the path. If the thought is that only the destination will bring happiness and the path is somehow to be covered, then the whole journey becomes arduous and there is no energy left to enjoy the destination. Cycling gives the right pace to comfortably stop at places to enjoy watching a lush green paddy field or a lake filled with blooming lotuses and to chat and inspire the cheering gang of children you see on the roads.

In a statement issued on Monday, Sinosoar-Etechwin Joint Venture said it learned from media reports that “a third party” had protested against Sri Lanka’s Cabinet decision clearing the project, on grounds of “so-called self-security”. “We firmly oppose any outrageous interference by any third party without legal and factual basis,” the firm said.  On January 18, Sri Lanka took a Cabinet decision to engage a Chinese firm to install hybrid renewable energy systems in Nainativu, Delft or Neduntheevu, and Analaitivu, off Jaffna Peninsula, located in the Palk Bay, some 50 km from the Tamil Nadu coast. Although New Delhi did not officially comment on the move, official sources confirmed that India had offered a $12-million grant, to execute the same. The project’s proximity to India’s coastline reportedly set off security concerns in New Delhi.  Colombo had originally obtained a loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the project. Sri Lanka’s Minister of Power Dullas Alahapperuma told local media that the government would consider India’s proposal, for it was a grant rather than a loan. But there is no change yet to the January 18 decision.  Outlining the tendering process in 2019, through which it obtained the project, the Chinese consortium said the “third party” — intervention “seriously affected” its reputation and legitimate rights, and “damaged the credibility and image” of the Government of Sri Lanka. The consortium is only responsible for the construction and handover of the project, it said, adding the firm would “strictly abide” by the laws and regulations of the ADB and the Ceylon Electricity Board.

The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or the Iran nuclear deal, proved that the IAEA can emerge beyond its mandate of being a monitoring and inspection agency and, in fact, play a key role in finding solutions to tense international crises. Last week, the IAEA and Iranian diplomats struck a “temporary” deal to continue inspection of Iran’s nuclear plants for three more months, which keeps at least the diplomatic path to revive the deal open.  As the preeminent nuclear watchdog under the UN, the IAEA is entrusted with the task of upholding the principles of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1970. Established as an autonomous organisation on July 29, 1957, at the height of the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the IAEA claims that it “works with its member states and multiple partners worldwide to promote the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear technologies”. Though established independently of the UN through its own international treaty, the agency reports to both the UN General Assembly and the Security Council.  However, there have always been questions about the Agency’s ability to work independently, without being drawn into big power rivalries.  What the IAEA missed in terms of real authority over sovereign states, it compensated for that by cultivating some tall leadership whose actions kept the issue of non-proliferation on the multilateral table. Both Mohamed El Baradei (1997-2009) and Yukiya Amano (2009-19) were vocal at difficult moments. Under pressure from the George W. Bush administration to back the American claim that the Saddam Hussein regime of Iraq was pursuing nuclear weapons, Mr. El Baradei maintained that he would not rush into a judgment on this matter without incontrovertible evidence that could prove that Hussein had committed a gross violation of non-proliferation. History proved that his cautious approach was right as the invasion of Iraq failed to yield the necessary proof of Hussein’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. While the agency played a key role in providing the platform for holding frank discussion about civil nuclear requirement for several countries, it proved to be ineffective to prevent power politics from influencing nuclear negotiations. This was particularly visible when Pakistan pursued a nuclear weapons programme in the 1980s and despite overwhelming evidence in possession of the American authorities, they did not pursue the case effectively through the IAEA because of the cooperation between the U.S. and Pakistan on the Afghan front.

The last time Indian aircraft took part in such an event was in 2001, on the occasion of the SLAF’s 50th year, according to Captain Vikas Sood, Defence Adviser at the Indian High Commission. A team of 4 Sarang Advance Light Helicopters, Surya Kiran (Hawks), Tejas Fighter Aircraft, Tejas Trainer and the Dornier Maritime Patrol Aircraft from India were in Sri Lanka this week, to participate in a fly past and acrobatic display event with the SLAF, held by Colombo’s seafront. Air Chief Marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauri called on Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, and met senior defence officials.  “The engagement was very positive, we look forward to building on our strong ties,” Captain Sood said.  During Sri Lanka’s over three decade-civil war, India has played a crucial role, politically and at times, using its military. While the controversial Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) presence here, and ‘Operation Poomalai’ of 1987 — when the Indian Air Force dropped food supplies in Jaffna — drew criticism from sections, the Indian military’s “support” has been repeatedly acknowledged by Sri Lanka’s national leaders.  In Sri Lanka’s post-war era, Indo-Lanka military partnership has focussed mostly on training and capacity building. According to Captain Sood, as many as 1,200 Sri Lankan military personnel are trained in India every year. “That is about 50% of the total training we offer, and shows the priority we accord to Sri Lanka,” he said, adding that Sri Lanka had “huge potential” to contribute to regional security.  Last year, Indian Navy and Coast Guard personnel helped the Sri Lankan Navy in a crucial fire-fighting operation, when an oil tanker went up in flames, off the island’s east coast. Further, Sri Lanka’s strategic location makes it a crucial partner for all countries in the region. Pakistan’s Air Chief Marshal Mujahid Anwar Khan was also in Sri Lanka to attend the 70th year celebrations. “This visit signifies the strong bond and friendship between the two countries and their Armed Forces,” the Pakistani mission here said. Over the years, Sri Lanka is known to have maintained strong military ties with several partners in the region and beyond.

The present effort to woo the settler farmers and gain the attention of the Thamarassery diocese is proof that both the fronts are convinced about the farmers’ crucial role in their performance. The victory margin of LDF’s George M. Thomas against his UDF rival V.M. Ummer last time was just 3,008 votes. In the 2011 elections, it was UDF’s C. Moyinkutty who trounced Mr. Thomas for 3,883 votes. In 2011, the total number of voters was 1,45,763. Though it increased to 1,68,412 last time, the margin did not witness a considerable change. The Mukkom municipality and six other grama panchayats (Karassery, Kodiyathur, Kodenchery, Koodaranhi, Puthuppadi and Thiruvambady) form this upland electorate. The difficulties faced by farmers following the fall in price of agriculture produce, wild animal menace, land disputes with the Forest and Revenue Departments and the buffer zone classification top the electorate’s concerns. It draws the prime attention of both the fronts for their election manifestos. Since the church’s stance is seemingly crucial for the significant victory margin, both the fronts are trying their best to convince the church about their farmer-friendly development agenda. The leaders of the Indian Union Muslim League have already met Thamarassery Bishop Remigiose Inchananiyil for support.  For the LDF, the entry of the Kerala Congress (M) faction has added confidence. They believe that the thin victory margin will be a thing of the past with the new ally having good support of the church. As part of the LDF’s election strategies, the church’s inclination for a candidate from the Christian community is also likely to be taken up. At the same time, the UDF is hopeful of staging a comeback, citing its several decades of hold in the constituency. Congress candidate Cyriac John and P.P. George were the winners here from 1977 to 1987. A.V. Abdurahiman Haji was the representative from 1991 to 1996. In 2001, it was C. Moyinkutty, who was elected to the Assembly. UDF’s dominance was affected with the entry of CPI(M)’s Mathai Chacko in 2006. For both the fronts, the increase in Bharatiya Janata Party’s vote share from 3% to 6% in the last election does not appear to be a major concern.

Second, his political opponent in the last election, the Kerala Congress (M), is now an ally of the Left Democratic Front (LDF), making the polls special for the electorate. In 2016, Mr. Ramakrishnan’s victory margin against KC (M)’s Mohammed Iqbal was just 4,101 votes. For the KC (M), it was a reason to rejoice, as the LDF’s victory margin in 2011 was 15,269.  The steady growth of the opponent, which was slightly a fear factor for the LDF, is now not a concern for it. Interestingly, both will fight together for a common candidate this time. The LDF hopes to secure 90% of votes in the constituency with the new tie-up. Though a section of KC (M) backed by the United Democratic Front (UDF) is not happy with the alliance, LDF leaders claimed that it would not make a major impact. Since the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is yet to garner even 6% of votes, the LDF is confident of an easy win.

Political observers attribute this to a predominantly well-educated population and a balanced mix of different communities in the largely agricultural region.  The unpredictable shifts in voting patterns during the past two decades have kept both the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) on tenterhooks till poll results were announced.  The 2016 Assembly election saw Eldho Abraham of the Communist Party of India (CPI)wrest the seat from Joseph Vazhakkan of the Indian National Congress (INC), who won in 2011. They got a vote share of 49.27 % and 42.70 % respectively, while P.J. Thomas of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) got 6.84 %.  In 2006, the voters had selected Babu Paul of the CPI, while Johny Nellore of Kerala Congress recorded a hat-trick, in 2001, 1996 and 1991, an exception to the varying voting patterns. An Independent, A.V. Issac, won in 1987, while candidates of Kerala Congress groups won in 1982, 1980 and 1977. Pennamma Jacob who won in 1970 was an Independent candidate. The constituency voted K.M. George of the Congress as MLA in 1957 and 1960. P.V. Abraham of the CPI won in 1967. Speaking about the peculiarities of Muvattupuzha located in Ernakulam district, M.P. Mathai, who retired as Director of Gandhian Studies from the Mahatma Gandhi University, said it was largely a rural constituency, although the town wore a semi-urban look. “There is now a demand from different quarters, including from political parties, that a district be carved out of Muvattupuzha. This might provide a boost to physical infrastructure of the region, but might take away the region’s identity as a locale sans pollution. Even now, devoid of much urban activity, traffic hold-ups are common in the town,” he said.  A pair of bridges remained underutilised — one which is incomplete and another which cannot be used for want of approach roads.

Vadakara constituency in Kozhikode district is one of the few segments in the State that has never elected a non-Left candidate to the Assembly. It remains to be seen if the record will be rewritten this time. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) has offered the seat to its socialist ally, Loktantrik Janata Dal, snatching it away from another socialist group, Janata Dal (Secular) (JD-S), whose leader C.K. Nanu had defeated Manayath Chandran of the Janata Dal (United) in 2016. The JD(U), the LJD’s former avatar, was part of the United Democratic Front (UDF) then. Ironically, Mr. Chandran, LJD Kozhikode district president, is a front-runner for the seat now. It was rumblings within the CPI(M) which led to a split and later the murder of rebel leader T.P. Chandrasekharan in 2012 that pitchforked Vadakara’s turbulent politics into limelight across the State and beyond. Ever since the split in 2008, when Chandrasekharan formed the Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP), offering an alternative brand of Left politics, every election in the constituency revolves around the position adopted by that party.  The RMP had a tie-up with the front for the local body polls in the form of the Janakeeya Munnani in grama panchayats such as Onchiyam, Eramala, Azhiyoor, Chorod, and Mavoor, and it could gain power in a few of them. If the tie-up continues for the Assembly polls, it will formalise the RMP’s alliance with the UDF.

It is not clear who will be the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate. It had fielded M. Rajesh Kumar last time. M.K.

The party’s strategy for the Assembly polls was evident from Mr. Gandhi’s speech at the conclusion of the UDF’s recent pre-poll rally, where he made rare scathing remarks against the Left.  There are many who are doubtful about its success as the perception about Mr. Gandhi has undergone significant changes after 2019. His interventions in national politics are now seen as sporadic public appearances and mostly limited to social media comments. The UDF’s victory in the LS polls is mainly attributed to Mr. Gandhi’s national image as a ‘secular liberal’ fighting a ‘right-wing Hindutva brigade’ led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Voters from minority communities and people without political leanings thought the Congress-led front stood a better chance to be an alternative to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the national level. This, along with the revulsion at political murders in north Kerala in which CPI(M) activists were the accused and the resentment against the Left Democratic Front government’s handling of the Sabarimala issue, sealed the UDF victory.

In the spring of 2020, Mr. Cuomo was hailed as a hero, who had waged an uncompromising battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, which ravaged his State. At the peak of the pandemic-wrought devastation, Flushing Meadows, the home of the U.S. Open, was converted into an emergency medical facility. Further, a 1,000-bed hospital ship was dispatched to New York City to take the heat off the struggling healthcare system of the state. Meanwhile the daily fatality rate in New York touched 800, and the daily hospitalisation soared to 18,000. However, by June 2020, the numbers were at 5 fatalities and less than 900 hospitalisations. At the heart of the gargantuan public health effort was Mr. Cuomo, with his hard-hitting daily COVID-19 briefings, relentless focus on data and positive messaging, and overall take-charge leadership style that even pitted him against the erstwhile Donald Trump White House. More than anything, his breakout leadership qualities propelled him onto the national stage of Democratic Party heavyweights, and whispers abounded regarding his potential as a future presidential candidate. Yet hardly could even the man at the centre of this unparalleled public administration victory through a lethal pandemic imagined how sharply his prospects would have slumped into a morass of disrepute. His problems began to mount on questions related to the pandemic itself, when research by an Albany think tank revealed that the Cuomo administration had downplayed and deflected questions on fatalities within New York’s nursing-home system. One of his aides, Melissa DeRosa, admitted to State Democrats last month that the Cuomo administration “froze” as the tragedy of thousands of senior citizens dying of COVID-19 mounted across New York, and in part that was driven by the fear that President Donald Trump would turn their perceived failure into “political football”. Experts observed that the spike in deaths in this niche demographic might have happened due to inadequate restrictions on nursing home staff, an honest if costly mistake that it might have been better to admit to. Yet Mr. Cuomo apparently could not back down from his high-power press briefings to strike such a sombre note.'], ['2021/03/13', 'news', 'Six killed in protests in Myanmar - The Hindu In solidarity: People holding up their mobile phones as they take part in a vigil in Yangon on Saturday.\\n\\xa0 | Photo Credit:    At least six protesters were killed by security forces in Myanmar, witnesses and media reported, as activists marked the death anniversary on Saturday of a student whose killing in 1988 sparked an uprising against the military government.

In the backdrop of the ongoing legal tussle before the Madras High Court involving courses in Anna University, sources said BU, too, offered the course.  At the time of releasing the selected candidates list, there arose a dilemma – whether to follow the Central government’s reservation system by including the EWS quota or to go by the State government’s 69% reservation model.  After discussing the issue with officials in the State Higher Education Department, the University decided to increase the number of seats by 10 — to take it to 20 — to implement the State government’s reservation system.  The increase was to follow the Tamil Nadu reservation system. The admission process followed by the University was based on this. Therefore, the course had 20 seats, of which the Central government sponsored 10.

It changed me physically, mentally and emotionally, it changed my life forever. I was riding back home from office in the evening. It started drizzling near a crossroads and I throttled up the motorbike. And all of a sudden, a motorbike from a left lane zipped past me. I braked hard and a car from behind hit my bike, flinging me across the road.  Some people ran over to help me and then, one of my colleagues just driving behind me saw my bike lying down on the side of the road. He immediately rushed me to a nearest orthopaedic hospital. I had sustained multiple fractures in my left elbow and a major fracture in the left ankle. This necessitated a surgery wherein I had silicon plates, screws, and wires inserted to hold my elbow and ankle joints in place.  It was a traumatic injury that caused me emotional, psychological, and physical distress disrupting my ability to function normally in day-to-day life. I was feeling completely lost. Being confined at home, I would spend some time thinking about the ways to work on my health and fitness along with the recovery process. I tried to explore different ways to stay positive. Reading self-help books and watching health and fitness videos had become my only recourse. Reading self-help books helped me process things at the mental level and for physical fitness, I started doing yogasana which helped me heal faster.  In the meantime, I joined a fitness group on Facebook, which had just kicked off a \"30 days’ plank challenge\".  I missed out on the initial three days of the challenge thinking that I would not be able to do that properly. Nevertheless, I mustered courage and started out from Day Four. Initially, I’d feel tremors in my core and could hardly hold the plank position for 20 seconds or so. However, 30 days into the challenge, I could hold the plank position for more than four minutes without tremors. That plankathon journey saw me from being a passive member to the most active member of the group.  Besides, I also started going out for a walk in the morning and after a few weeks into the walking exercise, I tried out running. I began by running 1 km, and gradually 2 km and 4 km. I slowly and patiently worked my way up to run for 5 km with reasonable pace.'], ['2021/03/14', 'opinion', 'Hurdles a woman should overcome - The Hindu We talk a lot about inclusiveness and teaching our sons to be better human beings in this hopelessly male-centric world of ours. No doubt we must do it, but we must also talk about the mental hurdles women should overcome if we are ever to even dream about an equal society. These hurdles grow with them and end up as a gigantic tree extremely difficult to be axed try as you may. Susan, my classmate, could never walk alone in that friendly co-educational college campus of ours. Whenever she wanted to go to the library, canteen or even restroom, she would ask one of her girl classmates to accompany her. All these places were just a stone’s throw from our classroom, but she never could muster courage enough to walk alone. This was of course 40 years ago, but I found it very odd that a girl should behave like that even then. If a woman is not at peace with the freedom she has, how can she ever be free or equal in this patriarchal world? My aunt Seetha was a wonderful woman. Widowed at a pretty young age, she fought against many odds in her life. She went on to become a teacher, won awards and made a difference in the lives of many underprivileged children whom she tutored. Though financially independent, she could never bring herself to live an independent life. She always clung to her relatives even if it was no bed of roses. Another thing she found difficult to do was walk into a restaurant and dine there alone. Though this might seem a trivial thing, in my opinion if not for her mental hurdle, she would have enjoyed many happy evenings in her life. After a day of hard toil when she headed home, she used to be invariably hungry and crave for some snacks and her favourite filter coffee. She just had to walk into a hotel that was just a few yards away to have her evening coffee, but she never could bring herself to do that. She is not in this world now but each time I think about her, I am reminded of the many number of cups of filter coffee she could have relished had it not been for her mental hurdle that prevented her from doing so. Mothers fight like tigers to educate their daughters these days, especially if they themselves are not so educated. They know that their daughters will grow up to be confident young women only if they get good education. These same mothers would be happy to send their daughters to the U.S., if an NRI lad comes along. Little do they think about the lonely hours and days their daughters will be doomed to confront, for their smart daughter cannot work there, as she has gone there as a dependent of her spouse. Isn’t it high time our mothers and daughters sprinted out of all their mental hurdles and state categorically that a girl’s career is as important as that of a boy’s and a smart educated girl cannot be expected to sit at home. India is a country of innumerable rituals and customs. A chunk of these can be done away with if women can put their foot down and firmly say no to it. In Tamil Nadu, as soon as a girl attains puberty, it is celebrated as a big event calling all the kith and kin. In this age of science and progress, I definitely think such an uncomfortable custom should be done away with totally. Unless women realise it and do away with such a custom that also costs a lot, it cannot be eradicated. It is time we started thinking about a progressive society where a girl’s coming of age is not a big event but what she achieves in life is! The great Indian wedding is another thing in which our women folks can think progressively. In most marriages, an exorbitant amount of money is spent for no reason at all. If women can force a cut on marriage expenses, ours would be a better country to live in. Let life begin more beautifully and more simple in all ways and let the great Indian kitchen be shared by man and woman together.'], ['2021/03/14', 'opinion', 'Once upon a breezy ride - The Hindu The day is winding down, making way for a graceful night and I feel a steady gush of wind over myself, disrupting my carefully done hair and flowing through my loosely fitting top. I am in an unlikely place of quiet content, the state I often find myself in, when I am travelling by autorickshaw. It is engrossing and subtly delightful for the senses, through the slanting afternoon sunshine finding where my feet are perched and the blink-and-miss sights of the cityscape. Perhaps I should dare not romanticise autos because of the bumpy reality of it, which often starts with the unpleasant and tiring haggling for fares.  And yet, autos are my favourite mode of travel to get around the nooks and crannies of the city, the long stretch of the beach road, the bustling streets full of bazaar shops, the roads with offices on either sides that are punctuated by tea stalls and roadside eateries, and the residential areas, with bougainvillea lending colour to otherwise-sombre terraces, just as unfettered plants enliven abandoned buildings. There is something about the auto journey that feels adventurous, perhaps the lack of windowpanes to draw a distinction between the outer world and yourself, the enclosed space thereby instantly making you a spectator, a witness to ongoing life but never an inherent part of it.  For all the cliched and superficial ‘wanderlust’ trend on social media, travelling can never be overrated. And not just travelling to exotic places but even simply getting around the city that you grew up in, witnessing its transition over the years, noticing how much of it has been improved to keep pace with the times and yet finding its heart and soul intact. There is something about travelling that leaves you lost in thought but perceptive at the same time, pensive yet alert, whilst taking in your surroundings, sharing a dignified silence with strangers who are also in transit, and sometimes, circumstantially, having conversations and finding commonalities in the lives of those you have crossed paths with.  There is, of course, a vast difference between undertaking a journey with a predefined purpose, a destination in mind, and those times when you are still weighing in your options in your head. In the latter, without strict time constraints, the journey is more fluid, more relaxed. In a sense, the more lost you are, the more freedom you have, to find your place in life. There is a joylessness in utter certainty the same way there is thrill in patternless chaos.  Journeys could be enriching, regardless of the destination, even if we take back with ourselves no souvenirs except our insights gained from wandering. And perhaps, every encounter we make, every place we go to, and everything we learn, is a gift of another experience.

I would rather cancel the planned journey than submit myself to travel in middle and upper berths. I dislike the middle berth more than I dread the upper berth. Until the lower berth passenger finishes reading his book, I cannot put up my berth and lie down at night. In the morning I have to remain flat like a corpse in a coffin until the lower berth passenger-partner chooses to open his eyes and decides at last to call it a night. I am leaving alone the upper berth since I am of the opinion that upper berths are made only for the \"Georges of the Jungles\". Due to this obsession with lower berth, I face a number of problems. First, I have to make my travel plans and book tickets well in advance. Now as a senior citizen, it is easier for me to get lower berths, but in the past when I was cruising through the salt-and-pepper stretch of my life, it was very difficult to get lower berths. Those days one has to go to the reservation counter to book the tickets. Every time I had to humbly pray to the booking clerk to be kind enough to allot me a lower berth. Not all booking clerks are merciful. \"You are not old, and you are not handicapped. Why should I allot you a lower berth,\" flared up a clerk once when I pestered him to check one more time for availability of a lower berth. He put me punitively on a side upper berth. Side upper berths are worse than machans from which Jim Corbett and Kenneth Anderson shot man-eaters. To ascend one, one should be a trained trapeze artist. The story did not end when I somehow got a lower berth. There, would often wait for me an old grandma or grandpa, to request me to exchange my prized lower berth with their middle or even upper berth. Whenever I was forced to sacrifice my hard-earned lower berth that way, I felt as if the trophy was snatched from my hand even before I ascended the podium. It also happened that whenever I happened to board the train at some wayside stations, I often found the lower berth allotted to me occupied. Such trespassers did not only occupy my lower berth but had the audacity to direct me to their upper berth.

Within days, one would land some occupation ensuring a livelihood. In all the 15 years of my living in Bombay and Mumbai in two spells, the city never experienced a complete power supply breakdown and with the efficient bus transport, the two service providers earned the name BEST (Bombay Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking). We enjoyed bottled milk from Aarey Milk Company, the first dairy in the country. The  s pioneered the on-the-dot, 100% correct delivery of food from home, rain or shine.

I enjoyed the ride in the double-decker tram to the library in South Bombay. Nobody had time to waste. The city went to sleep late to get up early. One never felt lonely on roads. Bombay fully deserved being called the financial capital of India.  In 1971, however, I decided to continue higher studies in Calcutta. As the Naxalite movement targeted only the political activists, the city continued to be the safest among Indian cities for women and old people. The city welcomed refugees with open arms. Trams provided low-cost transport for the poor. In case of accidents, the victims were taken care immediately, bystander apathy was unknown. Vision of future is a cultural trait in Bengal. For theatre and music (especially Rabindra Sangeet), the city now called Kolkata is famous.  A short second spell in Mumbai only made me yearn for Delhi for reasons of vast open spaces, parks and scope for fast private transportation for commuting to office.

A cup of coffee is a must to kick-start the body each morning. The accessories are as important as the beverage. A Styrofoam or even porcelain cup won’t do. To be savoured, coffee has to be served in a pint-sized shiny, stainless-steel tumbler with a matching saucer. The tinkling sound of the vessel, the aroma of the fresh brew and its instant relish ensure we are in heaven.  It is an experience to watch the art of coffee-making, be it in a wayside shack or your favourite restaurant. Milk is set on a low boil on one stove. The coffee-maker’s hands work in a flourish stirring the milk to a nice, creamy consistency. On the other side is the beaker with the decoction — deep-brown, viscous and with the perfect blend of coffee and chicory. The magician now gets into the act. He pulls out the stainless steel tumbler, adds a spoonful of sugar, a dash of decoction and tops the tumbler with frothy milk till it swells over the rim. And then, in an act defying gravity, the concoction is mixed with that deft horizontal flick of the beverage from the tumbler to be caught by the saucer and back again. There is a twinkle in his eye as he hands over the coffee. No questions asked. It is perfect, the way it is. On a long train journey, there is a different feel to drinking coffee. The moment the train comes to a halt, the station comes alive with hawkers advertising the beverage in their distinctive ways. Some intone “coffee-coffee-coffee” in a low, rhythmic baritone and others scream their throats off with high-pitched shrieks of “coffee-coffee”! For once, you settle for a paper cup.

And as in any year, the pressure is mounting.  Our education system relies almost entirely on marks. A few reforms here and some fancy terms there have probably given it a kinder and more student-friendly facade. But the compelling dependence on marks continues unabated. Hence, a vulnerable adolescent unwittingly becomes a subject of the most intense and microscopic critique purely on the basis of the grades. Overzealous relatives, friends, the extended family and even mere acquaintances pose direct queries about a child’s exam score. And god forbid, if it does not match popular expectation, they embark on a long, unsolicited discourse and draw parallels with other students, leaving the already demoralised child in a depressed state.  At the other end, we have parents of high-scoring students flaunting their wards’ marks card, trophy-like, on social media and gloating over their success as some kind of a personal achievement or well-executed project. I know of children who deactivate their social media accounts and switch off their phones on the eve of results.  Under the present education system, children get way better marks than those who took their exams seven or eight years ago. There is a mad scramble for admission to elite colleges and coveted disciplines.  The cut-off percentage stands at an incomprehensible 98 or 99 and in some cases, even 100. Not everyone is geared to handle this kind of sustained and ruthless competition. A few buckle under societal and parental pressure and choose the option of unfair means or worse still, self-harm. A couple of recent Bollywood films have tried to showcase this sad reality and sensitise the public to this mounting challenge. But the circus of marks continues, unrelenting and unforgiving as ever.

Mr. Balashankar, a former editor of RSS newspaper  , allegedly said the BJP’s State leadership had struck a pact with the CPI(M) to defeat the Congress in several vital constituencies. Purportedly quoting Mr. Balashankar, Mr. Chennithala said the RSS leader had stated that the BJP would channel its votes to aid the CPI(M) in Chengannur and Aranmula constituencies. In reciprocation, the CPI(M) would vote for BJP State president K. Surendran in Konni.  The BJP said Mr. Balashankar was peeved that the party had denied him a ticket. Hence, he had vented his ire on the State leadership, which had little say in candidate selection. The BJP’s national leadership made the final call. Moreover, the BJP said Mr. Balashankar had rarely evinced interest in contesting the Assembly elections.  Mr. Chennithala said the BJP-CPI(M) axis was not limited to three constituencies alone. The unholy nexus had metastasised to 140 constituencies in the State. The CPI(M) had sided with the Sangh Parivar to harm the Congress. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s so-called principled secular stance was a lie. He was in cahoots with Hindu majoritarian forces that sought to divide Kerala communally.

He said the people of Kerala were partly responsible for electing representatives and governments with negative attitude. The State’s attitude towards development should change. “The State got no industry in the last two decades. Wealth will not come without industry.

Pointing out projects such as Thiruvananthapuram Light Metro, Kozhikode Light Metro, Nilambur-Nanjangud rail line, Guruvayur-Tirunavaya rail line as examples of failed development schemes because of State’s politics, Mr. Sreedharan said that the State had shelved some good projects he submitted for easing the congestion on the roads.'], ['2021/03/17', 'elections', 'Kerala Assembly polls | Balasankar’s outburst may impact BJP prospects - The Hindu Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue R. Balasankar’s outburst against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State leadership and his sneaking suspicion that the party has a tacit deal with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] is likely to impact the prospects of the BJP in the Assembly polls. In its defence, the State BJP leadership, including party chief K. Surendran and Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan, has explained that his statement could have stemmed from the denial of the Chengannur seat. However Mr. Balasankar’s premise has provided plenty of ammunition to the Congress party which has often alleged that the BJP and the CPI (M) have worked out a covert deal in the elections. The Congress leaders have taken it up as a campaign issue wherever the party is in direct fight with the CPI(M) in the polls. But the Left Democratic Front has dismissed the allegation as baseless. For the BJP’s State unit, its leadership fears that the allegation will possibly lead to a situation where the party will lose a major chunk of Hindu votes, especially those of the Nair community, to the Congress in Central Travancore districts. In fact, it was Mr. Balasankar who has been trying to facilitate the parleys between the RSS leadership and the Nair Service Society, which has been successful to a great extent. He was also involved in the dialogues with the Orthodox faction as part of the BJP’s months-long bid to build an engagement with the Christian Church. A fallout of Mr. Balasankar’s statement is that the BJP machinery will now have to marshal multiple resources to retain the over 42,000 votes the party secured in Chengannur in the 2016 Assembly polls. To prevent the flow of votes of the BJP sympathisers to the Congress-led coalition, the RSS leadership, already in a damage-control mode, may have to come up with a counter strategy. A section of the RSS leadership believes that continuity of the Pinarayi Vijayan government would pave way for the further growth of the BJP in the State on the perception that many Congress leaders would desert the party after the Assembly polls.'], ['2021/03/17', 'elections', \"Kerala Assembly polls | Chennithala alleges fake voters on electoral roll - The Hindu Serious charge:Ramesh Chennithala alleged discrepancies in the voters’ list on Wednesday.\\n\\xa0 | Photo Credit:    Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Wednesday raised the allegation of voter identity fraud.

Struggling to survive post COVID-19 lockdown and grapple with the GST imposed on them, the industry wants whichever party that comes to power to address the issues in connection with the pollution it is alleged to cause and put pressure on the Centre for a more lenient GST system. Perhaps, the sector has more issues with the Centre than with the State, and GST is their primary concern. When GST for merchants who have chosen composition fee is 1%, it continues to be 5% for the restaurant sector. “We pay composition fee from our pockets so that we don’t have to levy it from the customer. This especially affects the smaller restaurants,” says G. Jayapal, State secretary, Kerala Hotel and Restaurants Association.  Despite handling a lot of production every day, restaurants have been included in the service sector by the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Department. Post lockdown, there was an announcement that the service sector would get the same benefits as the production sector, but it has not materialised. “Getting the benefits of the production sector will help us a lot in terms of GST and loan benefits,” says Mr. Jayapal, adding that the State should exert pressure on the Centre to solve these problems. A major tug of war between the sector and the State is the issue of pollution. Restaurants are often booked for discharging water into nearby drains even as they ask for an alternative. “Constructing sewage treatment plants is not viable for small restaurants and eateries. What should they do with the water, which is not really polluted but unusable,” asks Mr. Jayapal, a restaurant owner for 20 years.  The ban on plastic is another sore matter.

The front also hopes that the recent controversies over the gold smuggling case and its alleged links with the LDF candidate will favour it. “Voters know everything, and they will make the right decision,” say UDF workers. Meanwhile, LDF campaigners say no one can just think of a cakewalk by banking on the the local body election results. They add that the history of Koduvally is quite different as it has witnessed unexpected twists and turns. A constituency where the UDF enjoyed continuous victories from 1957 to 2001 is no more its bastion, they say. For the LDF, disagreements within the IUML over Dr. Muneer’s candidature in Koduvally have come as an advantage. The front claims that the number of IUML dissidents has multiplied in the constituency, which will create a favourable atmosphere for it in the election.'], ['2021/03/20', 'elections', 'Kerala Assembly Elections 2021 | Congress-BJP line getting thinner: Pinarayi Vijayan - The Hindu Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan introduces LDF candidates at an election convention at Thekkinkadu Maidan in Thrissur on Saturday.

With this, T.N. Harikumar of the BJP has replaced N. Sreenivasan of the BDJS as the coalition’s candidate in the segment, taking the total number of seats contested by the national party in the district to seven. The BDJS, meanwhile, will contest from two seats; Vaikom and Poonjar. Though the Ettumanur seat was originally allotted to the BDJS, the announcement of Bharath Kaipparedan as its candidate had triggered a row within the coalition. Alleging an unholy nexus between the BDJS and the CPI(M) in the candidate selection, the BJP raised objection, forcing the BDJS to announce Mr. Sreenivasan as its new candidate. Meanwhile, a similar issue cropped up in the coalition in Poonjar as well when the BDJS’s plan to field M.R. Ullas in Poonjar fell flat in view of a High Court order barring aided schoolteachers from contesting the elections. Following this, the BDJS decided to field its district president M.P. Sen in the segment. The infighting within the coalition, however, touched its boiling point on Friday when BJP district president Noble Mathew and Mr. Harikumar, filed papers in Poonjar and Ettumanur respectively as against the nominations submitted by Mr. Sen and Mr. Sreenivasan. Sensing trouble, the leadership of both parties kick-started discussions to resolve the issue amicably. It was decided to hand over the Ettumanur seat to the BJP while the BJP nominee in Poonjar will withdraw his nomination soon.

The crippled industry has been struggling hard to cope since 2016 and the crisis assumes even larger proportions post COVID-19.  Though there were signs of revival during the last couple of years, the sector has once again hit a major roadblock. The labour-intensive industry, that used to employ around 3 lakh labourers, is badly in need of emergency relief measures. “Of late we have seen a drastic fall in fortunes and only a special economic package can keep the industry going. Though our wages seem very reasonable in Kerala, it’s higher compared to other States. At present we are unable to afford it and in order to support the sector, the government can offer a share by integrating the industry with Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MGNREGA) scheme,” says Nizamudeen I., president, Federation of Cashew Processors and Exporters.

The announcement literally shook up things and pitchforked the constituency into prime time news almost overnight.  While the LDF’s decision to allocate the seat to its ally Kerala Congress (M) was expected, it was the choice of candidate that surprised even the rival fronts. The decision to field Sindhumol Jacob, the CPI(M)-backed block panchayat member from Uzhavoor, did not go down well with the local CPI(M) rank and file, not to mention the outburst of KC(M) councillor and long-time seat aspirant Gils Periappuram who raised the spectre of ‘payment seat’ against party chairperson Jose K. Mani. Having resigned from the party, Mr. Periappuram has since campaigned against KC(M) candidates in Kottayam. To make matters worse, news spread that Ms. Jacob who was a CPI(M) branch committee member from Uzhavoor was ousted from the party to make way for her contest as the KC(M) candidate. Later, party district secretary V.N. Vasavan clarified that she was no longer a member and hence there was no need for an ouster. The constituency has been a pocket borough of the Kerala Congress (Jacob) with the late T.M. Jacob representing it five times. The incumbent is his son Anoop Jacob, now a two-time MLA. The United Democratic Front camp remains confident of securing a hat-trick of victories for Mr. Jacob by exploiting the churning within the LDF over the candidate selection. The prognosis being that the grass-roots workers of the CPI(M), who even otherwise were reluctant to campaign for KC(M) having opposed the party all these decades, have been further antagonised by the ‘imported’ candidate.  The CPI(M) camp, however, shoots down this argument claiming that its cadres are well regimented to set aside their predilections in the face of the party decision. It is further pointed out that the decision to field the candidate, a Jacobite married to a Knanaya Catholic, was not reckless, but a shrewd and tactical one against the backdrop of the prevailing feud between the Jacobite and Orthodox factions of the Malankara Church, which remains a critical electoral issue in the constituency. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has taken back the constituency from its ally, the Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS), and fielded M. Ashish, a two-time panchayat member. The party hopes to improve on the vote share of the BDJS candidate in the last election by taking advantage of the national leadership’s mediatory role in the Church feud. It expects its Nair candidate to receive the support of both the Jacobite and Orthodox factions. Since both the LDF and UDF candidates are Jacobites, the BJP calculates that the Orthodox faction will not vote for them and that the Jacobite votes will get split. ']]\n",

In this hugely successful sequel, the iconic scene is the exhumation of the skeleton from under the floor of the police station. As the skull and the appendicular bones pop from the pit, the audience would feel a shudder through their body. My sons reflexively closed their eyes. Irrespective of one’s age and courage, the sight of a skeleton is undoubtedly ghastly and unpleasant.  Typically, the human skull and the long bones have been symbolic markers of death and danger since time immemorial. One would have watched the symbol of a skull with crossed bones in electric boxes to represent serious danger. The human fear for skulls has been effectively tapped by shamans and practitioners of black magic and their armamentarium is never complete without the skull placed in front of them on the floor. The femur or the tibia bone is dexterously waved through the air by the oracles while mumbling esoteric chants to ward off evil spirits. In the uncivilised barbaric days, the leaders of tribes and small kingdoms used to adorn their thrones with skulls of their victims as a mark of their prowess and bravery.  But for a doctor, skeletons are one of the first-level gurus to learn the art and science of medicine. The 206 bones are intricately linked by joints, ligaments and muscles and form the basic framework of the human body. It won’t be an exaggeration to say that without the articulated skeleton, we are nothing. Once a student joins the medical school, the first stepping stone is to learn the basic anatomy of the human body and the skeleton. But the three-dimensional orientation of the bones and joints cannot be learnt through textbook pictures alone. Hence, we need to get the bones in hand, either natural or artificial. Commercially produced plastered-skeleton models are prohibitively expensive. At this juncture comes the huge role played by the attendants of the anatomy lab, who prepare the cadavers and anatomy specimens. Through guidance from our seniors, we gingerly approach those wiry, carefree souls to provide us the “real” human bones. After a gentle bargain, the price is fixed at a few thousand rupees. Through a delicately structured network involving the workers of burial grounds, they would collect bones and deliver it to us in a gunny bag. But the pricey catch is never complete. We will be extremely elated if we get all the major individual bones and the representative ones for the ribs and vertebra. Only the lucky and blessed few may get the rare ones like the Atlas bone, and the unique carpal and foot bones.  As a responsible son to account for the money spent, I brought the gunny bag and gleefully showed it to my unwary parents, only to see my mother swoon at the grisly sight. Then it was an unwritten rule that my prized collection should be kept in a corner of my cupboard and should be brought out only during defined hours.

It struck me that this is indeed the time for a myriad of colours of roses to blossom. And I recalled I had not seen so many roses together in my little garden for many years. There is a government school about a hundred metres from my house, and a majority of the students use the lane in front of my house to reach the school. There is also a smaller convent school close by.  March is the time when junior schools announce their results with parents and children flocking in colourful dresses. On the way to collect the report cards, some daring children would sneak in the half-open gate of our house and pluck a few roses to gift to their class teachers. It is an unspoken language of gratitude and thanks-giving. All the reprimands and punishments would be forgotten by both the teacher and the pupil. A fortnight later they would do the same when the new session would start with a new class teacher.  That’s where our roses would disappear. I never had the heart to stop the enthusiastic children from making use of my garden to thank their teachers. I remembered my children too doing the same, except that their mother would buy them a bouquet each on March 31.  The coronavirus had shut all schools, and online classes even for five year olds became the norm. The charm of the pranks played on classmates, playful interaction with other students, reprimands from teachers and then a brief vacation after the exams is gone. The students would be quietly moving on to a higher grade without the thrill of it. With a decline in COVID cases and the vaccination drive, students may soon get a chance to reclaim the fun of schooling.

A cup of coffee, apart from being a delicacy, arranged a space of collective reflection over the functioning of the state. It became a democratic platform that vested its power in the common masses to freely participate in political debates. The arguments, discussions and opinions originating in the “coffee house” led to the formation of a public sphere that challenged the domination of the status quo. The “coffee house” that exist today lack the political commitment of the 18th-century “coffee house”. With the advent of consumerism, our focus has shifted from the “political” to the “popular”. This alteration has dumbed down the reasoning ability of the masses, hence reducing them to “unthinking individuals”. Emerging from this age of the “popular”, social media provides us with a new understanding of the “public”. The 21st-century social media echoes the hope of the “coffee house” which was to formulate a large-scale collective action. With its easy accessibility and impartial atmosphere, social media can be viewed as a renovated version of the “coffee house”. It is a space of social gathering where people come together to discuss issues ranging from the bliss of their domestic lives to the disturbing aspects of grim politics. The democratic platform of social media offers us an opportunity to engage in public speech, question the normative and voice our opinions. Sociologists Eliher Katz and Paul Lazarsfeld affirmed that the conversation on social media materialises in two steps. The opinions are firstly broadcast by the media, which are then diffused by the common masses. The second step is where the hope lies. The large-scale circulation of a particular opinion leads to a collective understanding of that notion. This mutual consciousness further leads to the formation of a public opinion which confronts the normative ideal of the authorities. During this process, if the strength of the “collective” overpowers the legitimacy of the authorities, a revolution can be forged. Having looked at the political potential of social media, it is important to acknowledge that social media is not able to bring about the same mass mobilisation as the “coffee houses” of the 18th century did. The answer to this lies in the practices of consumerism, censorship and sensationalism which consume a large portion of social media. These tools serve as obstacles in the process of fostering “collective awareness”. The words and pictures of the content we post on social media might be ours but we are not granted ownership of the entire post. Our posts can be easily censored, manipulated or removed if they do not meet the demands of the social platform. These hurdles reduce the potentiality of social media to initiate a mass movement.'], ['2021/03/21', 'opinion', 'Game on, and how! - The Hindu After a long COVID-induced break, sports events have resumed across the world. Exciting times ahead with the Tokyo Olympics set to begin on July 23. The sports industry, however, will never be the same again — it will only be far better. Uncertainties are always overcome by survival instincts. And a motivated generation is training in sports schools. Modern Olympics was cancelled four times, including an earlier one in Tokyo. But unlike earlier Games, huge investments are made for contemporary Olympics to project the image of the host country. Cancellation of the Olympics will cost Japan more than $12.6 billion. A year’s postponement now means additional billions to keep facilities in shape till the Games start. The main challenge is to ensure that the Games do not become an international super-spreader event. Tokyo cannot host spectators and guests as planned earlier. The risk of fans catching the virus and the event being suspended midway lurks. Olympics is large in scale and intensity of participation by athletes, officials and spectators from all corners of earth. Even assuming that everybody at the Olympics is vaccinated, precautions are essential so that the event is not cancelled midway due to a quirky variant virus. The stadiums can at best host 50% or less capacity. Empty stadiums as at the U.S. Open or English Premier League are best avoided. French Open did better with a 10-20% occupancy. A COVID-negative or vaccination certificate was made mandatory for entry. Open stadiums pose less risk and indoor stadiums can be made safer with turbo exhausts.

I began to think that it would not be a bad idea to begin living here in my cottage in a remote village, surrounded by deep valleys and snow-capped peaks that radiantly begin to glow as the first rays of the sun appear in my bedroom window. I take quiet walks on cloudy days or when the days warm up through thick weeds in the wild and empty valleys and dark forests that enfold me. I lead a pastoral life, eating vegetables and homegrown apples and apricots or sometimes baking a bread, leaving my experiments to the whims of the unpredictable yeast and the intensity of the fire that will dictate the quality of my baking. The hot oven incarcerates me in full attention on a cold winter day when it is not possible to stir out. Though I have now left behind the institutions of higher learning, history, classical philosophy, political theory and fine arts are my only refuge. My essential loyalty to taking all serious and light reading as a commitment to leisure has been a gratifying experience in times when leisure seems so rare. Sitting on the stump of a fallen tree on one of our excursions into the wilderness and surrounded by a cluster of pines, I began to deliberate on how humans think they are outside nature, perpetually driven towards an intellectual life to keep up with the ways of the world. I realised that the environment in which I received my upbringing drove me towards the life of the mind, to arts and literature, to the study of ancient drama and the joy of classical music. Not for a moment did my parents show concern for what benefit a poem or a painting would have in enabling me to find my way in life. But my father made sure to tell me of how as a professor he would constantly inform his students that when they come to his class they need to be prepared to purge themselves of their prejudices and inflexible postulations, thereby discarding the Cartesian position of a blinkered or an insulated life cut off from the outside world. I loved the school I was sent to, its wooded surroundings, the green playing fields and the open-ended discussions in the class overriding the prescribed texts or curriculum; we freely answered and tossed issues, questioning each other or the teacher who appreciated the standpoints that we adamantly took as if they were deeply profound. We were often avidly stirred on in discussions meandering in and out and times reaching no ending. But sometimes a light shown on some revelation which left us euphoric till the next day class. There was no air of intellectual condescension, no discomfort at asking a silly questions, no way we could mortify ourselves.

For the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), the threat is serious in the Koduvally Assembly constituency, where a senior party leader is reportedly unhappy with the official candidate. The withdrawal of the leader from active campaigning has upset many active IUML workers and the district leadership of the party. “The main concern for the district leadership is the big local support for such disgruntled leaders, who are mighty enough to influence the vibrancy of united electioneering,” said an IUML campaigner from Koduvally. Afraid of open protests and demonstrations, the official leadership was reluctant to take disciplinary action against such leaders or to keep them out of campaign activities, he added. In Thiruvambady, disagreements over selected candidates have become a headache for both the UDF and the LDF. Several posters echoing local sentiments continue to be a concern for senior leaders. The disgruntled leaders have remained silent about the protests by their supporters against the official leadership. In Balussery, many local UDF leaders are keeping out of active electioneering due to their disagreement over the official candidate. Though the district leadership has claimed that there are no threats to upset the smooth campaign, the absence of influential local leaders in electioneering points to internal rows. The case is not any different in Elathur, where senior Congress leaders are part of the local protests against the official candidate. As a quick solution, both LDF and UDF campaigners are planning to introduce some star campaigners to patch things up.

One switched on the set some two hours prior to the start of daily programmes for the valves to heat so the pictures on the screen develop clarity. A solo channel and a characteristic sound with a blue screen left an indelible mark on our generation. \"Sorry for the interruption\", was a recurring message though; however, articulate newsreaders and good programmes kept us enraptured. Colour transmission started with live coverage of the 1982 Asian Games. Television then was synonymous with DD, or Doordarshan.  Growing into the college years, the youth in us wanted to explore the world to develop better survival instincts. We frequented standalone theatres that dotted our cities to watch Hollywood movies. The accompanying ride on our bicycles around the central business district was our favourite pastime. In our early 20s, a drive in a car was a dream-come-true. A visit to the local pub added to our youthful exuberance.  Growing out of our engineering degrees in the late 1980s, most of us drifted towards a life in IT. Engineering graduates from various disciplines converged on plush IT jobs to find a firm foothold. People made a beeline for learning programming languages — BASIC, PASCAL, FORTRAN, COBOL and so on. The freshly minted IT professionals engaged in client-facing roles in early stages of a software development lifecycle. DD now meant Due Diligence, an exercise to collect all relevant requirements and interact with the client stakeholders to kick-start a software project.  Growing our family wings to step into middle age, many were diagnosed with this disease. ‘Digital Intoxication’ has overtaken our life interactions mandating screen-view compulsory, as in Smart TV, laptops, mobiles and so on. Symptoms have led doctors to diagnose various syndromes such as carpal tunnel. On a recent flight, my co-passenger was headed directly to a retreat camp from the airport. A ‘ring-fence’ experience to relive the life in its back-to-roots sense. DD here is the Digital Detox programme.  Growing into the 50s, having leveraged digital platforms, we started to connect with our primary, high-school, and college mates, and journeyed through the bygone days. A get-together meal to break the ice was a template proposal. This provided an opportunity to size up our true-life journey — priorities, personality, and philosophy among other things that define each one of us. It was noticed that many friends trundled along an esoteric path dwelling in the spiritual well-being. A question popped from a corner — are we ready for DD, only this time it meant to be Demystifying Death!  By the time we understand life and its trials and tribulations, DD would have taken us over — Done & Dusted. We will remain a name for our next generation in a memory series.

But alas, no one in the city knew what filter coffee was, let alone having a pouch of decoction to sell. But just when I had lost all hope, my best friends sent me a couple of bags of the most authentic South Indian filter coffee powder, a brand new filter coffee press, and a bag of fresh murukku! As I opened the bag of coffee that my friends got roasted and ground especially for me by a Chennai store, the sweet aroma of fresh coffee brought back a flood of memories that took me back to the seven years I spent in South India before I moved to Chandigarh following the outbreak of COVID-19.  I knew little about coffee before I moved to Manipal in coastal Karnataka to study engineering. My experiments with coffee began with a shoddy mix of boiled instant coffee and frothy milk passed of as espresso at a Punjabi wedding in the late 1990s when serving coffee after dinner used to be a fad and symbol of wealth. Growing older, my uninitiated, teenage self fell in love with an oversweet iced coffee that a national \"fast-coffee\" chain misleadingly called Kaapi Nirvana. It was only in Manipal, where our hostel mess served strong-smelling coffee in small, steel tumblers, that I tasted the purity of South Indian filter coffee. I knew not then what one had to do with the small bowl that accompanied the glass, but I had finally tasted Kaapi and knew what Nirvana was. My trysts with coffee found me trying French Press and Dalgona coffee long before they became Internet sensations. But nothing gives me more peace than a piping hot cup of South Indian filter coffee.  Locked down in Chandigarh, I missed filter coffee, and even tried some of the new, readymade filter coffee decoction that are available online. They make a good cup of filter coffee, almost as authentic as the ones I used to love having in South India, and perfect for post-lunch Zoom calls to keep drowsiness at bay. But on weekends, I start my days by brewing a cup of perfect coffee, patiently watching the decoction come to life, which also creates the perfect crucible for some creative brainwaves to visit me. A friend of mine recently taught me how to photograph filter coffee for posting pictures on Instagram — the coffee must be poured into the steel glass from a height to get a bubbly froth that would make anyone weak in the knees. Top this off with a few drops of the decoction, and your filter coffee is picture-perfect. For my friends and relatives reading this, you now know what to gift me!  rishabhkochhar92@gmail.com  '], ['2021/03/28', 'opinion', 'For them, work is worship - The Hindu The last time that I saw him was almost four decades ago, but his face is familiar as if I saw him yesterday. A lean man of medium height in his early fifties with uneven teeth and greying stubble of two or three days on his face, he spoke chaste Kannada, with a Tamil accent. I am sure he won’t complain about this article — for, one he would be 90-plus, if alive, two, his literacy was limited to painfully scribbling his name on leave letter forms and most important, he never complained about anything.  He was a worker in a public sector undertaking in Bengaluru, where I joined as a shift engineer in the 1980s. His job was to carry material and semi-finished tool components on a trolley to different sections of the shop and also to the neighbouring production units. Having no other skills, he must have been doing the same job all his life.  This factory had an interesting work methodology. Suppose a job needed five raw materials, a job card would be raised with only two or three of them. It was the headache of the engineer concerned to somehow procure the others and complete the work on time! Our man knew exactly which mechanic had squirrelled away which material. He would come and say, “Armuga has this MS plate with him. Go and talk to him nicely. He will give you”, or “Machine shop II supervisor has this stainless steel rod. Go and give an indent to him. He will give you. Better hurry up.” With the passage of time, he became more dominating: “I have brought this rod from scrap stores, saying it is for you. Go and give the indent soon. Don’t forget and spoil my name!” He had also acquired some engineering knowledge: “OHNS is not available. No worry. You can use HCHC. It is available with Thomas!”  He also had a hold on the heads of the neighbouring units! If something is held up in the heat treatment unit, he would directly fight with the manager and see that our items were cleared in the very next firing on the furnace. If the inspection of any finished article is delayed, he would go and talk to the supervisor, “What is this? My boss has already received three calls from GM about this” and most likely, it will be cleared by the end of the day! I am yet to figure out, how, with no knowledge of drawings or even writing, he could identify our jobs!  During breaks, coffee and tea would be served at our tables. He had voluntarily taken upon himself to wash the cups of four or five supervisory staff. But if, by chance, we had a guest from a neighbouring unit, he would tell to his face: “I will not wash your cup. Wash it yourself!” '], ['2021/03/28', 'opinion', 'A dog without a home - The Hindu She looked like a “waif”. Abandoned or lost from a comfortable home, a Pomeranian-Indie mix. She has heartbreakingly and piercingly brown eyes, a sleek, slender body and smart ears that stood up like the ears of a doe.  Standing in the middle of a herd of barking strays, she looked so fragile, and defenceless and vulnerable, letting out a series of yelps that felt like cries of distress till we rescued her. A migrant construction worker nearby offered to adopt her and take her back to his village in Odisha. My daughter gratefully gave her up to him as he appeared kind and willing. Much as she would have liked to keep the little creature, she already has a Labrador and constraints of space and resources prevented her from going forward. A couple of days later on making enquiries, we found that the person who wanted to adopt her is a breeder, and Rani, as we started to call her, was running a risk.  So we brought her back and kept her with us for a few days till we found options. Rani, sweet as she was, appeared anxious and tense. She roamed around our place as if in search of someone she had lost, would sleep only fitfully, ate poorly and let out her heart-rending shrieks periodically. She responded to affection by placing her tiny head on our laps or licking us all over. Time came when we had to bid her a teary farewell and put her under foster care, having found one with a caring considerate woman. Soon with her amiable ways, Rani conquered all hearts and got used to her green surroundings. Photographs showed a smiling Rani bonding with her caregivers.  Posts were put up on Instagram, WhatsApp, and soon a crowdfunding campaign was under way and dog lovers chipped in for her stay at foster care. Then a decision was taken to neuter Rani to keep her safe, and the neutering took place at a vet’s, with anxious strangers-turned-friends of Rani. Also vaccinated and dewormed, Rani is still at foster care and her stay is running out. Again posters are drawn up with photographs of Rani soliciting a home for her where the inmates would want and welcome her as one of their own. Rani is still waiting for a loving, protective home.

The radio commentaries (television was some way off) of Anant Setalvad, Pearson Surita, Suresh Saraiya, Tony Cozier, Henry Blofeld and Richie Benaud still ring fresh in my mind.  I remember that even a quarter century by an Indian batsman those days was applauded as a milestone, and a six by a Salim Durrani or a ‘Tiger’ Pataudi was received with rapturous applause, for sixes those days were rare. I still recollect the thrill that Eknath Solkar’s sixer gave me even when the entire Indian team was bundled out for a mere 42 runs by the Englishmen in the summer of 1974. The white flannel trousers and full shirts, the nature of the pitches, or the kind of stumps, shoes, pads, gloves, bats and balls of then may appear antediluvian to today’s cricketer.  Physical fitness had nowhere assumed the importance it has today! Spare a thought for an Indian batsman, without any of the protective gear that is available to the modern batsmen and conditioned on a diet of spin and flat pitches, having to face bowlers of the pace of Lillee, Thompson, Hadlee or the formidable quicks from the West Indies.  Commercialisation of cricket, which perhaps started with the Kerry Packer series, in the late 1970s, was viewed by most purists with suspicion and even disdain. The advent of T20, the IPL and the gravitational shift of the power centre of cricket to India with the Board of Control for Cricket in India becoming one of the world’s richest sports bodies, the coloured clothing, the logos and the brands, the day-night matches, the sponsors and the money, the advancement of technology, the cameras, the Decision Review System, the emergence of trainers and sports psychologists, the “democratisation” of the game and the emergence of young cricketers from the remote plains and places of India driven by a fierce will to “make it”, have made this game almost unrecognisable from what it used to be!'], ['2021/03/28', 'opinion', 'The Birhor and the jungle fowl - The Hindu Red junglefowl, female, Gallus gallus, Sattal, Nainital, Uttarakhand, India\\n\\xa0  As a former Indian Forest Service officer, my father, S.E.H. Kazmi, is a treasure trove of anecdotes and stories from his days as a conservator.  On his way to a routine forest inspection with an Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF), a Range Officer and Bahadur, the driver, he suddenly saw this Birhor man — he can recognise them anywhere in the world with their incredibly swift and yet acutely alert walk — walking hurriedly on one side of the kutcha road, a hapless jungle fowl hanging upside down on his shoulder.  The foresters pulled over and stopped him to inquire where exactly was he headed to and what plans he had for that fowl. “I’m going to the weekly market to sell this jungle fowl for some rice,” he said.  Before my father could ask another question, the ACF butted in with a terse, “Do you even know who the sahab is? He is the DFO [Divisional Forest Officer]. Don’t you know that hunting a jungle fowl is illegal? Do you want me now to put you in jail for killing this jungle fowl?” The Birhor looked them up and down for a few seconds, thoroughly unimpressed with the ACF’s proclamation of the so-called high official status.'], ['2021/03/28', 'opinion', 'A swallowed coin - The Hindu Indian currency stock photo.\\n\\xa0  Just a couple of months ago on a Sunday afternoon, I got a frantic call from a young doctor that his little son had swallowed a coin. The X-ray he sent me on WhatsApp showed the coin in the child’s stomach. A swallowed coin is surely a major concern. Complications are possible. But from the X-ray, one could easily infer that there was no emergency. It was “safely” lodged in the stomach — at least for the time being. I reassured my friend. In most such cases, the dictum is “wait and see”. Of course, he also knows that, but reassurance was the need of the moment. As a senior doctor, I told him that I would send the X-ray and other details to all my friends in India and across the globe and get their opinions.  Obviously, it was easy to take out the coin from the stomach through an endoscope. But all my friends suggested the typical wait-and-see option. A paediatric endoscope was unavailable in nearby hospitals. The question of whether it was an old coin or a new one also came up because the size difference could matter in a child. Of course, no such clue was immediately available. I started sending the WhatsApp messages I got from my friends to him. There were clear explanations on how the coin will safely pass through the bends, coils and bottlenecks in the stomach and intestines.  One of the gastroenterologists was the most optimistic, saying, “The Indian rupee is so ingeniously made that it will neither swell in size nor value. So, absolutely nothing to worry.”'], ['2021/03/28', 'opinion', 'Young officers, buck up - The Hindu Man made word IAS with wood blocks\\n\\xa0  Service of India — the ambition of Gandhiji was “to wipe every tear from every eye” — should be every civil service aspirant’s zeal. Once in service, over time, a plethora of reasons cause a deterioration of this idealism. Empathy with concerns of the public, which once provided synergy for the burning passion to join the service to make a difference to their lives, “is not now as it hath been of yore”. The single-minded pursuit of the officer slowly, but steadily, gives way to indifference, indolence, incompetence. It graduates into narcissism with its attendant squabbles “trying” for “plum” postings as the “be-all and end-all”. Public perception of a “successful” officer negates any introspection. Borrowing Oscar Wilde’s words, “…begins by deceiving one’s self, …one always ends by deceiving others”. During my initial days in service, I kept two lists, one of officers I should emulate, and the other whose traits to eschew. Years passed by; the first list became shorter, the second longer — Gresham’s law of bad driving good out of circulation. Where greater things are given, greater will be expected. So are the hopes pinned on civil servants, whose role ahead is critical. Its challenges — fulfilment and frustration — should be faced with equanimity. The constitutional concepts — socialism, now a dead letter, and secularism under challenge — are no more a sheet anchor. The Right to Information and the Prevention of Corruption Acts lose their teeth, leading to a yawning gap between the mounting problems and the sharpness of the tools to solve them.

Their focus shifted once again when Kerala Congress (M) chairman Jose K. Mani, a key ally of the Left Democratic Front, inadvertently raised the bogey of ‘love jihad.’ At a television show the other day, Mr. Mani had stated that society indeed had some apprehensions about the practice. “As the issue has emerged again, the apprehensions about it should be cleared,” he had told a news channel. The statement instantly kicked up a political row with the Bharatiya Janata Party, which has promised an Uttar Pradesh model law against ‘love jihad’ in Kerala, swiftly pitching in and the Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council extending its support to Mr. Mani. Put on the defensive, the LDF sought to tread a cautious path fearing that a further flare-up of the issue would alienate Muslim voters. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan sought to sidestep queries on the topic even as CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran termed the remark a personal opinion of the KC(M) leader. Sensing trouble, Mr. Mani too came up with a statement that his position on the issue was consistent with that of the LDF. “The key agenda in the election is the development projects implemented by the LDF government. The current controversy is part of an attempt to divert attention from these initiatives. Hence, such controversies hold no significance at present,” clarified Mr. Mani. But that Mr. Mani did not reject the theory of ‘love jihad,’ a stance in direct contravention of the position of the LDF, particularly the CPI(M), was indeed a ploy aimed at the dominant Catholic votes, according to observers. “As the concept has gained deep traction among the Catholic community in Central Travancore, the traditional vote bank of the KC(M), an outright rejection of its existence would have been suicidal for Mr. Mani,” a veteran Kerala Congress leader said.

Retaining Nemom, which O. Rajagopal wrested for the party in 2016, is perhaps as important for the BJP as increasing the number of MLAs. The task of retaining the constituency for the party is now on Kummanam Rajasekharan. While the Left Democratic Front is banking on former MLA V. Sivankutty, the United Democratic Front's eleventh-hour decision to field Congress MP K. Muraleedharan has raised the Nemom fight to a high pedestal. The contest for Kazhakuttam, where the LDF triumphed in 2016, is seen as a test of the sharpness of the Sabarimala controversy as a poll weapon when LDF's Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran and BJP State vice president Sobha Surendran face off. The UDF's choice, public health expert S.S. Lal, adds an interesting element to the fight there. The LDF holds 10 of the 14 segments in the district, having upped its 2016 tally by one in the October 2019 bypoll when it wrested Vattiyurkavu from the UDF.

But, beneath the calm is simmering a high-octane political battle.  From construction ban to title deeds and agrarian distress to a split in the Kerala Congress (M), issues abound its poll-scape, which began heating up much before the official announcement of the Assembly elections. At the same time, this also happens to be a battle where pressure groups other than major outfits such as the High Range Protection Council and the Pembilai Orumai do not have much of a role to play. The Catholic Church, which has been in the forefront of several public agitations over the decades, remains surprisingly silent this time.  While the battle across the five Assembly segments here is primarily between the Left Democratic Front and the United Democratic Front, the stage is set for a direct fight between rival Kerala Congress groups in two seats. The LDF, which had won three seats in 2016, later added one more to its tally with the KC(M) switching sides. The UDF, which currently has just one seat, seeks to leverage the anger against the construction ban on buildings and the anti-incumbency factor to work in its favour. The coalition’s performance across the region primarily depends on the Kerala Congress led by P.J. Joseph, which commands a significant presence here. The LDF, on the other hand, counts on the development projects initiated across the region and the distribution of title deeds and welfare pension. However, the controversy over former MP Joice George’s derogatory remarks about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi appears to have dealt a major blow to its election campaign in the final lap.

The other theories include probable ED raid at the Bengaluru-based IT firm of the daughter of the Chief Minister and the agency booking a case against Speaker P.

Incidentally, Swapna had stated to ED that the Speaker had handed over a bag to Sarith, which contained a packet, that was to be handed over safely to the UAE Consul General in Thiruvananthapuram.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Union Ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Prakash Javadekar and Smriti Irani, BJP national president J. P. Nadda, and others have gone on whirlwind tours covering large swathes of the State. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has spearheaded the UDF election campaign. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Sachin Pilot, Salman Khurshid, Jairam Ramesh, A.K. Antony and Shashi Tharoor lend leverage to the UDF’s election pitch.  The LDF had approached the poll campaign with a measure of confidence initially. At least three pre-poll surveys had given the ruling front an edge over its rivals. The LDF’s emphatic win in the local body polls in 2020 had imbued it with a degree of confidence. However, the surge of crowds at BJP and Congress rallies has prompted the LDF to strike a more guarded approach in the campaign’s final stretch. Tellingly, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has cautioned LDF workers against placing undue trust in pollsters and asked them to guard against overconfidence. The Congress and the BJP have attempted to wrest the electoral narrative from the LDF by deploying national-level influencers. Top leaders of both parties seemed to target undecided voters. Mr. Modi has obliquely referred to the UAE gold smuggling case that had dogged the LDF government. Referring to the Sabarimala issue, he said the Kerala government had “used lathis against devotees and trampled on their faith.” Mr. Gandhi has talked about the LDF’s alleged attempt to allow foreign trawlers to raid the State’s traditional fishing grounds. He also promised a law to preserve Sabarimala traditions. Ms. Vadra spotlighted governmental corruption, nepotism, crimes against women, “inherent misogyny” in the LDF, political murders, backdoor appointments and unemployment. In contrast, the LDF has opted for a low-key approach. Apart from a few and comparatively less frenzied roadshows by CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury and Polit Bureau member Brinda Karat, it has focused on door-to-door campaigning.

A closer look at its electoral history suggests that Ettumanur may not hesitate to look beyond party preferences while sending its representative to the State Assembly. The victory of George Joseph Podipara in 1987, a former Congress leader who contested as an independent, stands as a case in point.

After a two-decade long reign by the the Kerala Congress(M) , the seat swayed to the Left through the CPI(M) leader Suresh Kurup in 2011 and has remained with it ever since.

The July 2020 study, carried out by the IISc's Interdisciplinary Centre for Water Research (ICWaR), raises pertinent questions about dam management and points to the need for improved, region-specific rainfall forecasts and judicious land use for flood mitigation. The office of the Accountant General (Audit 1) here had engaged the services of the IISc for the study.  On March 30, the Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said that the IISc finding was a ''charge sheet'' against the LDF government. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy told a press conference here on Thursday that the UDF would take necessary follow-up action if it came to power as scientific studies have proven that the disaster was man-made. Citing reservoir authorities, the study notes that the rule curve was not followed for reservoir operations in Idukki and Edamalayar during August 14 to 18, the peak flood period. The flood cushion between full reservoir level (FRL) and maximum water level (MWL) was not utilised in Idukki during the period. If the flood cushion of 110.42 million cubic metre (MCM) had been used, initial spills could have been reduced. At the Idamalayar dam, the storage volume between full reservoir level (FRL) and maximum water level (MWL) was partially utilised, but the flood cushion was not utilised to its full capacity, it says. Absence of accurate rainfall and flow forecasts affected reservoir operation during the flood period, the study notes. Although the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) furnished rainfall forecasts during the period, they were ''not region-specific within the district and were also not accurate,'' it noted.  Analysing land use land cover (LULC) changes between 1985 and 2015 for assessing their impact on the floods, the study found a significant increase in the built-up area in Idukki and Ernakulam districts.

Works taken up by the LDF government have benefited the people too. My administrative experience as the head of three-tier panchayats is an added advantage,” she says. For the record, Ms. Jameela had been president of the Thalakkulathur grama panchayat and Chelannur block panchayat. This is her second tenure at the helm of affairs of the district panchayat. However, Ms. Jameela claimed that her political opponents had now resorted to a social media campaign against her to mislead the Muslim community. “Some people have edited the video of a speech that I delivered at a seminar long ago, to claim that I am an atheist. It is completely false, and the move is to confuse people. My opponents have nothing else to say against me. That is why they are personally targeting me,” she said. LDF candidates have been winning from Koyilandy for three successive terms now, and Ms. Jameela is quite sure of retaining the seat.

The circumstances leading to this decision were not atypical of Nepal’s polity or the vicissitudes of communist party politics, but Mr. Nepal would certainly be leaving the UML with his rival and current Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli in a much stronger position than he had expected after the Supreme Court on February 23 had overturned Mr. Oli’s decision to dissolve Parliament in December 2020.

Ms. Lam, who was sworn in by President Xi Jinping a month before she turned 60, had over decades of working in Hong Kong’s bureaucracy garnered the reputation of a hard-working, effective and capable bureaucrat. Hong Kong’s civil servants often like to quip that the SAR, as Asia’s financial centre, may not make anything, but it makes things happen. Ms. Lam embodied that spirit. She acknowledged at her swearing-in that Hong Kong was “suffering from quite a serious divisiveness” and said her “priority will be to heal the divide”. Little would she have imagined that four years on, not only does that divide remain as far as ever, but Ms. Lam leaves behind a controversial legacy that many in Hong Kong say has permanently redefined what it means to be the Chief Executive (CE) of the SAR.  Ms. Lam triggered the unprecedented protest movement in 2019 that brought millions to the streets, by proposing a controversial extradition Bill that would allow suspects to be repatriated to the mainland. The protests against the Bills led to broader calls for democracy and for universal suffrage. Hong Kong’s residents only vote for half of their 70 legislators, with the rest nominated by pro-Beijing bodies. The CE is also not voted for, but chosen by a Beijing-backed Election Committee. Ms. Lam subsequently wholeheartedly backed Beijing’s crushing response to the protests, starting with a new national security law in 2020 and unprecedented changes to Hong Kong’s electoral system announced on March 30 that have drastically cut the share of democratically elected representatives. The number of elected legislators has been cut to 20 while the Legislative Council has been expanded to 90, thus ensuring a permanent majority for Beijing-nominated politicians and all but ending the pro-democracy movement. Born in British-ruled Hong Kong in 1957, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor graduated from St. Francis' Canossian College, according to her biography on China Vitae, and then entered Hong Kong University to study Social Science. According to a Reuters profile, Ms. Lam is the daughter of a Shanghai immigrant and a Hong Kong mother with no formal education, and grew up in a small apartment in Wanchai where “her bunk bed doubled as a desk; she used to stand on the lower tier and rest her schoolbooks on top.” A top-ranking student, she joined the British government’s civil service in 1980, and rose to become Chief Secretary under her predecessor, Leung Chun-ying. When appointed in 2017 by the Beijing-supported Election Committee, Ms. Lam was, in one sense, an expected choice, having proven her credentials as a capable bureaucrat. Yet she would soon find, despite her long experience, her government facing Hong Kong’s biggest crisis since the handover, one that she triggered.\"], ['2021/04/03', 'news', 'Taiwan train crash suspect freed on bond, prosecutors lodge appeal - The Hindu A Taiwan court on Saturday released on bond the manager of a construction site, whose truck authorities believe caused a train accident that killed at least 51 people, as family members mourned the dead at the crash site.

We were nearing Tirupathi, in high spirits though a little tired after more than a day’s journey when the ticket examiner with an intimidating moustache entered our compartment. I got frightened with the frequent mention of my name Kannan in the heated exchange of arguments that ensued between my uncle and the ticket examiner. Soon, we realised that it was Periya Kannan, my cousin, who was in the eye of the storm. He was elder than me and tall for his age. The ticket examiner looked rather menacingly at the overgrown Periya Kannan and insisted on a full ticket for him, accusing my uncle of falsifying his age to get concessional fare. My uncle could not produce any evidence for proof of his age as in those days there were no Aadhaar or PAN card which could be given as proof that the boy was only 11 years old. My grandmother panicked and pleaded with my uncle asking him to pay for the full ticket with a penalty. The ticket examiner threatened that he would get my cousin out of the train at the next halt. My uncle, a stickler for rules and upright person, would not budge. We were very close to the next station when the train, fortunately, came to a halt in the outer to get the signal clearance. The entire compartment was now charged with tension with all the co-passengers pitying my uncle but remaining helpless, unable to break this impasse. My grandmother started making fervent prayers to Lord Venkatachalapathi.

I came under fire from all my relatives for not realising the gravity of the situation, while my uncle suddenly rushed towards the ticket examiner and whispered something in his ears. To our surprise, the ticket examiner and all the passengers burst into laughter. My uncle had asked the question if the Railways would refund the excess fare charged from that person.

Different religious traditions have different ways to mourn the passing of a person. We are familiar with the scene of mourning in a movie. The black-suited ones in Hollywood films or the white ones in Bollywood. Whether Christians, Hindus or Muslims, their traditions allow for the last rites to be performed without delay. But funeral gatherings among Buddhists stretch a week or two in places like Ladakh. Over such a span of time, the gloomy atmosphere dies down to an extent where people seem to cheer about doing ritual things. The ambience of the family home is never quiet and sober. And the tradition has it that close relatives of the deceased wail for the sake of those who come to console them. To come out of the grief of death, it is first essential to immerse oneself in its gloomy waters. How would one claim to take a swim just by standing on the shore? One has to take the plunge and feel the deepest levels of sorrow. It doesn’t necessarily mean crying all the way down or remaining sad or depressed all the time. What it takes is an atmosphere of silence and quietude so that a grieving individual could go deeper into his being to reflect on the imprint of memories left by the deceased. In that process a cry or two out of genuine regret and a sense of loss, would wash away the guilt of having spent not enough time with the loved one. And when the grieving person touches the innermost depths of grief, it is much easier for him to come out of it by the sheer pull of force that normal life exerts over us. Tibetan Buddhists lay stress on the subjective mind to be able for a person to lead a happy life. They seem altogether to ignore the objective conditions. Why would a person need quiet and peaceful atmosphere to meditate otherwise? Buddha got enlightenment under the bountiful Bodhi tree. Similarly, without objective conditions necessary for a grieving environment, a person could not grieve to the fullest of his being. And parts of him would be left empty and unhealed. One may look normal yet deep inside he or she might be undergoing a grieving process that is yet to complete its cycle and heal. He or she may not have the grief gone but have become part of it over the years.

I recently read about a woman who filed a case against her abusers 26 years after the incident, her son actively supporting her to do so. In the past, a woman would not report rape because somehow society made her feel defiled, damaged and responsible. Had she been a good girl, worn decent clothing, not gone out at night, she wouldn’t have been raped is the message she subliminally imbibes. As for reporting milder degrees of sexual harassment, it was laughable. What is the big deal? Men will be men! You should even take it as a compliment. Someone finds you attractive (as an object). If such an allegation was levelled against someone who had power, things are worse. The woman was seen as a trouble-maker and an attention or publicity (female) hound. All this has changed with #MeToo. It has also sensitised men to the problems faced day in and day out by women. Fundamentally rape or sexual assault and harassment is more about power and dominance and not really about lust. It is a way of violating you in your most private intimate space, physically and emotionally. That is why it is so horrifying when some insensitive judge asks the perpetrator of sexual assault to marry his victim. Will you marry a wild animal that has assaulted you and left you with physical and emotional damage? We have no real statistics about the prevalence of rape globally because it is grossly under-reported. U.S. statistics report incidence of 19% for women and 1.7% for men. As a woman in India, I feel whatever maybe the stats for rape, 100% of us have suffered sexual harassment in some form or the other.'], ['2021/04/04', 'opinion', 'Reluctant heroes - The Hindu I have often wondered about ‘true greatness’ in people. No, not the ‘greatness’ that makes one famous, popular, a hero, a leader and so on! Such greatness is not necessarily a reflection of one’s true self and may have an agenda. Haven’t you come across random persons who seem to exude goodness and instinctively give you the feeling that they are very different and stay a level above the rest of us? Almost saintly? And such persons are often so ordinary and do not command any of the attributes that define greatness or make them stand apart. Since they don’t stand apart, you will not notice them unless you want to! I was idly thinking about such persons that I have had the privilege to associate with in my life, those who I truly admired, not for any great act of valour, sacrifice, charity or anything else that society glorifies, but just little spontaneous acts of love and care that set them apart. When I made a shortlist of such persons (there were hardly half a dozen of them in my life), I found that all of them were simple, ordinary folk, most of them had no claim to status, money, power, intelligence, education, knowledge, social skills, leadership qualities and so on. I was absolutely sure that I scored high above them in each of these attributes… but I know I cannot match up to them! But then why did I consider them far superior than me? What is it they had that I didn’t? These people, I felt, had absolutely no facade — not in their attire, countenance, gestures, words or for that matter anything that defines an individual and always came out just as they were and completely genuine, not a bit cultivated! Not even a tiny fraction of their visage was ‘made up’! With them I felt sure that their thoughts, words and actions were totally aligned without the slightest deviation! Not all of them were even ‘successful’ going by our worldly yardstick! They were ignorant of the art of self-promotion and creating the ‘right’ impression. Well, they never felt the need because they were least bothered by what others thought of them and never tried to be anything more than what they were! This was exactly what created a great impression on me! Then I consciously tried to identify those traits which made them so special, so much at peace with themselves and the world around, so different from the others I knew.'], ['2021/04/04', 'opinion', 'A life spent flying fighter jets for two countries - The Hindu Ramanathan Iyer \\xa0  Ramanathan Iyer, a retired Colonel of the South African Air Force and a Wing Commander in the Indian Air Force till 1996, lived an extraordinary life and passed away at the age of 69 on March 17 doing what he loved best: flying a military aeroplane. I first came across Rama, as he was popularly called in the IAF, in June 1981 as a cadet at the Air Force Academy in Dundigal. Accosting me one morning in the cafeteria, he said, “You seem to be a serious bloke. Do you know your vital actions before take-off — rattle them out and you can go.” By then, Rama was already an A2 qualified instructor and much liked among cadets — he was calm, soft-spoken, an excellent teacher and treated his pupils with kindness and dignity — not a very common thing in those days when most instructors followed the maxim of “spare the rod and spoil the child”. He was also smart and handsome and had a swagger with a touch of benign arrogance when dealing with authority and protocol that was so typical of fighter pilots in those days. I lost touch with Rama for a few years and then met him again at the Flying Instructors’ School at Tambaram, where he was a “super instructor” training rookie flying instructors like me.  The next I heard about him was when he was commanding the same MiG-21 squadron that I went on to command a few years after him, No 30 Squadron, also called the Rhinos. Rama was the kind of commanding officer all budding fighter pilots would love to have — always leading from the front, flying his pants off, an excellent communicator, receptive and open, sociable, and most important, would stand up for his boys whatever the consequence. Teaching seemed second nature to him, and I bumped into him again at the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington where he expounded on air power among other things. It was in Wellington that he was surprisingly passed over for promotion to the rank of Group Captain despite his stellar record. With children still in school, not many would have had the guts to quit and search for flying opportunities in military aviation in of all places, South Africa. I reckon it was an advertisement for flying instructors that attracted him there. What followed was an extraordinary career in the SAAF. Granted a three-year temporary commission in 1998 as a Colonel, Rama continued to gain the respect of the SAAF leadership as a flyer and a thorough aviation professional, staying on for 20 years in the SAAF in various capacities as a flying instructor, flight safety inspector, display pilot, instructor at the SAAF Staff College and more. After retirement, he continued in aviation as an instructor with South Africa’s civil aviation body. It was on a Patchen Explorer, a vintage single-engined reconnaissance aircraft, that Rama went down recently in Pretoria along with Major General Desmond Barker (retd) on March 17. Tributes continue to pour in for the two in South Africa with one report stating, “The deaths of retired military aviation legends General Desmond Barker and Colonel Rama Iyer were described as a huge loss for South Africa’s aviation sector.”'], ['2021/04/04', 'opinion', 'If wishes were horses - The Hindu Movie clapper board on blue background for filming equipment\\n\\xa0  “And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it,” wrote Paulo Coelho in  .

Some coins. Many take to painting or gardening or making handicrafts. There are hundreds of hobbies that are pursued just for enjoyment. Amateur radio, or Ham as it is otherwise called, is a unique hobby. A big attraction is that it allows you to communicate from anywhere: from the top of a mountain or from home, or even from behind the wheel of a car, without relying on the Internet or a cellphone network. One can even talk to astronauts aboard the International Space Station from your bedroom.  The current year, 2021, marks the centenary of the hobby in the country. In January 1921, Amarendra Chandra Gooptu of then Calcutta became the first Indian to get the licence to be an amateur radio operator. He was soon followed by Mukul Bose from the same city.  However, the number of enthusiasts in India is very low, nearly 45,000. Considering that the first public demonstration of electromagnetic waves was done by India’s pride and legend, Jagadish Chandra Bose, this number is pitiable. A major reason for this is a lack of facilities for training and inadequate information.  Most get to know about amateur radio only during disasters such as floods and earthquakes. Some positive movement happened in 1984, when the then Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, himself an amateur radio enthusiast, waived the import duty on wireless equipment.

It has been a race to grab the eyeballs and the mindspace of the indecisive voter, the ones who can swing the results in at least some constituencies. Owning and sustaining the narrative has been a challenge for all fronts in social media, where trends hardly last a day. Right from the beginning, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) has attempted to ensure that continuity in power and developmental and welfare initiatives of the government would remain a buzzword in all discussions. The United Democratic Front (UDF), meanwhile, focussed its attention on the flurry of allegations raised by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala. They also attempted to harness the popularity of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, promoting his rallies, shop visits, autorickshaw rides and deep-sea diving to garner hits. Both the UDF and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also have attempted to keep ‘faith’ as an issue in the limelight, with constant references to Sabarimala womenn entry issue. This campaign also witnessed popular professional vocalists lending their voices for the party campaigns. While Sitara Krishnakumar sang ‘Urappanu Keralam’ and Sooraj Santhosh composed ‘Hridayapaksham’ both for the LDF, Vaikom Vijayalakshmi crooned ‘Naadu Nannakanayi’ for the UDF. These numbers went viral on multiple social media platforms. All the candidates activated their dedicated social media pages, with live broadcasting of vehicle rallies. The re-sharing of content from lesser-known candidates through the official party pages or that of star campaigners gave them more visibility. The candidates who had ensured a keen following on their pages much before the elections, had a clear upper hand over the new entrants to social media. When the opinion polls from various news channels began coming in, these were perhaps the most shared items on social media, but even most supporters of the LDF, which came on top in most surveys, have been critical of the survey methodologies. In the final week of the campaign, with Chied Minister Pinarayi Vijayan daring the UDF to have a debate on development, the Left supporters too joined in with a development challenge hashtag campaign. The debate heated up as former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy responded with a Facebook post on development and welfare during the UDF tenure, leading to multiple rebuttals from either side. With Kerala’s penchant for the written word, Twitter, with its word limits, has not become a factor in setting the narrative in the State, unlike at the national level.

Moreover, the tight vigil maintained by polling officials and additional preventive measures introduced by the Election Commission appeared to have paid off. “Our officials had put in a lot of hard work and came out with a mechanism to prevent bogus voting, which was approved by the High Court and the Election Commission. It paid dividends,” Chief Electoral Officer Teeka Ram Meena said. “We have ensured that no bogus voting occurred,” he said. However, a few complaints did make news. United Democratic Front candidate in Taliparamba V.P. Abdul Rashid demanded a repoll in the segment, accusing the Communist Party of India (Marxist) of ‘capturing’ booths. Allegations of bogus voting were reported from Koothuparamba, Mannarkkad, Kalamassery, and Kattakada. At Mananthavady, Vypeen, and Parassala, some voters reportedly found that their votes had already been cast beforehand in the form of postal votes. Reportedly, these voters had never applied for postal ballots.

In all, the electorate of 44 Assembly segments will vote in the fourth phase on April 10. Of the 44 seats, 14 are spread across the two districts of north Bengal, nine are in Cooch Behar and five in Alipurduar district.

The move has drawn wide condemnation, including from the country's Tamil polity and civil society. Late on Friday, the Jaffna Magistrate’s Court released him on bail, on a surety bond, amid a growing backlash.  In the early hours of Friday, police arrested the Jaffna Mayor Viswalingam Manivannan, in connection with the municipal body assigning light blue coloured uniforms to a newly set-up team tasked with monitoring environmental violations.  Police likened their uniform to that worn by the “police force” run by the LTTE in areas that the rebel outfit controlled during the civil war.  Police spokesman DIG Ajith Rohana said “promoting” symbols associated with the LTTE, including uniforms, was an offence under Sri Lanka’s Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), a law that activists deem draconian, and have been campaigning to repeal. Last month, the government expanded the ambit of the PTA, allowing the detention of anyone suspected of causing “acts of violence or religious, racial or communal disharmony”. Authorities had indicated that the Mayor would be detained and charged under the PTA, but subsequently, the charges were framed under Sri Lanka’s penal code.  Jaffna parliamentarian and senior lawyer M.A. Sumanthiran, with a team of 25 juniors, appeared for Mr. Manivannan. “We made submissions that the LTTE police force has not been there for over a decade, and that the government is seeing a ghost behind every bush,” he said. \"], ['2021/04/09', 'news', 'Bhutan-China officials meet, agree to schedule much delayed boundary talks soon - The Hindu The 10th Expert Group Meeting (EGM) on Bhutan-China boundary in Kumming, China. \\xa0 | Photo Credit:     Bhutan and China have agreed to set up the next round of much-delayed boundary talks between them “as soon as possible” and discussed a roadmap for expediting the boundary resolution, a joint release of the 10th Expert Group Meeting (EGM) on the Bhutan-China Boundary held in Kunming announced on Friday. The upcoming talks, the 25th round of the boundary talks mechanism, will be the first since the Doklam standoff in 2017, and the first since China made new claims on Bhutan’s eastern boundary bordering Arunachal Pradesh in June 2020.  “The EGM was held in a warm and friendly atmosphere, and held in-depth and fruitful discussions on the boundary issue in keeping with the close ties of friendship and cooperation between Bhutan and China,” a joint statement issued in Kunming at the end of talks between senior officials from Arpil 6-9 said.  “The two sides agreed to continue to maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas pending a final settlement of the boundary issue,” it added, referring to the annual boundary talk mechanism that began in 1984, and was followed by two agreements on the maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the border areas in 1988 and 1998.  Since then 24 rounds of talks have been held, but there have been no talks scheduled since 2016, ostensibly due to tensions over the Doklam standoff between India and China over PLA transgressions in Bhutanese territory, and more recently due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

According to a study conducted by the Phew Research Center (PRC) in collaboration with the Centre for the Study of Collapsing Societies (CSCS), 7.5 out of 10 Indians don’t know what ‘EVM’ stands for, let alone the protocol for managing EVMs that flee the polling booth and infect people’s cars, homes, and hearts. For instance, one gentleman from Valasaravakkam, quoted in the PRC-CSCS study, believed that the full form of EVM was ‘Extra Vote Machan’, which is patently incorrect. Nor does EVM stand for ‘Excellent for Vote Manipulation’, as some people on social media have been saying. So what exactly is an EVM? What does it do? And most important, can it be relied upon to safeguard the glorious Indian democracy from the efforts of Opposition parties to win elections? The answer to all these questions is ‘Yes!’ But sadly, these are the wrong questions. They won’t come in the Board exam. The real question, as usual buried by mainstream media, is why are EVMs spreading so much faster than the coronavirus? According to reports in alternative news sites, the most affected States right now are Assam and West Bengal. In Assam, for instance, one of these super-spreader EVMs went to the extent of hijacking a car linked to a BJP leader, causing a repoll and the suspension of four polling officials. Sceptics explain away this dangerous proliferation of EVMs by arguing that elections make EVMs go viral. But that doesn’t explain how EVMs, which are supposed to exist only inside polling booths or other EC-authorised premises or transport vehicles, are turning up at odd places even in States that are not in the middle of elections. Take me, for instance. I live in Delhi. There are no assembly elections going on in Delhi right now. Not that it would matter since the Delhi government, by definition, is not a body of individuals voted to power by the people of Delhi but an unelected bureaucrat — exactly like in the good old days under the East India Company, when ordinary people did not have to travel all the way to a polling booth only to find that the unhackable EVM was sitting in their own imagination all along, right beside free and fair elections.  In my case, when I took my car for an RT-PCR-EVM test, I was certain it would test negative. But to my shock, it tested positive for EVMs. It was, however, asymptomatic — there was no sign of any actual EVM, either on the seats or in the boot. Nonetheless, given how fast these EVMs spread, as a responsible citizen, I put out a social media post announcing that my car had tested positive for EVM. I requested all car owners who may have used the same roads as me on the same days I did to have their vehicles tested for EVM and quarantine them in any case, if they wished to avoid what I had to undergo.'], ['2021/04/10', 'sport', 'Sasikumar enters final - The Hindu Top seed Sasikumar Mukund sailed past fourth seed David Poljak of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-2 in the semifinals of the $15,000 ITF men’s tennis tournament on Saturday.

Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi in February, with protesters refusing to submit to the junta and demanding a return to democracy.  After over two months of military rule, efforts to verify deaths and confirm news of crackdowns have been greatly curtailed by the junta’s throttling of mobile data — shunting most of the population into an information blackout.

Prince Hassan had been Crown Prince for more than three decades and was almost sure to ascend the throne. But he accepted the King’s decision and when Hussein died on February 7, 1999, Abdullah became the new monarch. As per the dying wishes of his father, King Abdullah II appointed his half brother Hamzah bin Hussein as the new Crown Prince. Hussein, who sacked his brother from the line of throne for his son, may have hoped that power would transfer from his one son to another in the future. But history repeated in a few years. In 2004, after consolidating power both within the royal court and the Hashemite family, King Abdullah stripped Hamzah of the Crown Prince status. According to Jordan’s Constitution, the King’s eldest son would inherit the throne when then King departs unless he wishes otherwise. In 2009, ending all uncertainty, the King named his 15-year-old school-going son, Hussein bin Abdullah, the new Crown Prince. Prince Hamzah, like his uncle Hassan, accepted the King’s decision. But he did not stay silent forever. He occasionally raised criticism over the way the country was run. The growing discord in the royal family burst into the open last week when Prince Hamzah and a few other officials were detained for targeting the country’s “security and stability”. Intelligence sources told western media that the Prince was put under house arrest over a plot to unseat the monarch and that “foreign hands” were involved in the plot. Later, Prince Hamzah’s phone and Internet lines were cut, his bodyguards removed and the Jordanian media barred from reporting on the palace crisis. Interestingly, it was Prince Hassan who negotiated peace between the King and the rebelling Prince. Born in 1980 to King Hussein’s fourth wife, the American-born Queen Noor, Prince Hamzah was one of the favourite sons of the late monarch. King Hussein often described him as “the delight of my eye”. He attended Harrow School in England and then joined the U.K.’s Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He also attended several military courses in Jordan and is holding the rank of Brigadier in the Jordan Arab Army. He had served in Yugoslavia under the umbrella of international peacekeepers. Over the years, Prince Hamzah, who has a strong resemblance to his father Hussein, has also cultivated strong ties with the Bedouin tribes of the East Bank, the core support base for the monarchy, and many see him as a more popular heir apparent to the King than the current Crown Prince, the 26-year-old Prince Hussein. And he often amplified the voices of dissent and criticism in the Kingdom, by raising questions on the government of his half brother.   The Hashemite Kingdom has long projected itself as an oasis of stability in a volatile region. Wedged between the Palestinian West Bank and the war-torn Syria and Iraq, Jordan has been an important American ally for years, playing a critical role in the U.S.’s military and diplomatic efforts in West Asia. The palace feud has cut open the long-simmering wounds within the Hashemites, who claim their ancestry to the Prophet Mohammed and had ruled Mecca and Medina for centuries until the Saudis captured the holy cities after the First World War.  A key challenge King Abdullah faces is the growing anger among Jordanians about government policies. There are widespread corruption allegations. As a stable country in the middle of a conflict zone, Jordan has accepted millions of refugees from around the region over the years, which has stretched its finances. The economic woes mounted in recent months after COVID-19 struck the country. About 7,000 died due to the virus in a country of 10 million people.  When nine COVID-19 patients died after a government hospital in Salt, a hillside town near Amman, ran out of Oxygen last month, anti-government protests broke out. Later Prince Hamzah visited the town, met the families of the deceased and consoled them. Local people invited the Prince for a traditional feast two weeks later. Within a few weeks, the palace crackdown on Prince Hamzah unfolded.

Rather, Captain Nair, which is how he introduced himself to me. Nair was a sprightly 80-year-old gentleman. Almost bald, with a very slight build and shorter than most men. The most noticeable part of him, though, was his broad smile, which, for a first-timer on these roads, would look permanent. But when you came closer, you could see that he was busy saying “Good Morning” to anyone he saw during his morning walk. He would lift up his hand a little above his head in his own unique wave, all five fingers apart, while he greeted everyone. That included children going to school, runners, security guards of the houses lining the street and even the obnoxious bunch of walkers who insisted on going abreast, talking politics loudly. I knew he must be older than 80 because of the way he walked. His legs were bowed, he took very small steps and there was a noticeable bend in his spine. Of course, I didn’t ask him about his age when we introduced ourselves one day. I had just finished my run and I was gulping down water when he approached me. “I am Captain Nair.” He smiled. I introduced myself too. “Finished your jogging,” he asked. I was offended that he called it “jogging”, because we runners are a proud lot. But I didn’t say anything. Respect for elders has been ingrained into me by my upbringing. After exchanging pleasantries, we asked each other where we lived. We found we were just walking distance apart. He then invited me to his house for tea. I promised I would, but not today. He said he lived alone and told me his address, which I promptly forgot. But during every morning run after that, whenever he waved “Good Morning”, I had an impulse to stop and ask for his address and when I could visit him. I wanted to know how he lived all by himself, how he stayed so cheerful and so many other things. He seemed like an interesting gentleman that I would love to get to know. But runners don’t like to break their rhythm; so I kept putting it off. One morning, I made the resolve to talk to him before I started my run. Maybe go to his house for tea.

When the parched earth gets the first rain, there arises a smell. I don’t think there is anybody who doesn’t like the smell. And when the monsoon starts, the rain has no smell but only music and magic. Within days, the rain breathes new life to the summer-ravaged vegetation. The creepers and the thickets appear from nowhere. The trees and plants get renewed energy, foliage and beauty. What magic! With a sudden touch, the rain performs myriad wonders.  The frogs and the innumerable insects celebrate the rain with their never-ending orchestra. It seems that the croak of the frogs is the outstanding tune of this orchestra and the shrill sound of insects takes the next place. The rain has its own music and it inspires the frogs and other insects to come forth with theirs. The drizzling rain has its gentle, soft and slow-pitched music; the pouring rain has its brisk and fast-pitched music; the torrential rain has its fearful music and the sound of the accompanying wind, thunder and lightning makes it awesome. Even if the torrential rain is fearsome, at night it is a lullaby which no other music can provide us. If there is pouring rain in the early morning, no child loves to arise and go to school. They love to lie lazily under the blanket and listen to the music of the rain. In my childhood, we have had many spacious open places in our village. The most spacious of them were level plains or meadows, little hillocks and rocks full of palms and big mango trees and it was intermingled with clusters of bamboo. It used to be both our playground and the grazing ground of our cattle. The grassland was the habitat of many birds, including lapwings. To see this beautiful place at midnight against the background of a full moon and star-decked sky is an experience that can’t be described in words. The moonlight which falls on the palm leaves will make them silver-coated. The gentle breeze would help the leaves create a mesmerising music. No man-made music seemed to me as sweet as this music of the elements. The long shadows of the palm trees, the moonlit shade of the bamboo clusters, the occasional hooting of the owls, the sound their wings make when they fly, the howling of the foxes, and the chirping of the lapwings create a wonderful symphony that captivates us and helps, as Keats says in his immortal  , to “leave the world unseen” and “fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget… the weariness, the fever, and the fret” of the human world where “to think is to be full of sorrow/And leaden-eyed despairs”. And to see this place when it rains was also an ecstatic experience. The sound of the rain falling on the palm leaves, the swinging of the bamboos in the wind and its sound, the bowing down of the rain-drenched bamboo tops, and the clearly visible slanting raindrops all over the meadows used to captivate and thrill me.'], ['2021/04/11', 'opinion', 'A meeting with Phoolan Devi - The Hindu Heading the HR function of the Railways, I had public representatives of different political persuasions make routine visits to my office.

One day we crouched inside, lowered the lid carefully and balanced the flap on its iron clasp allowing some air space between lid and box, and yelled for help. What joy it was to watch our cook and mother dashing about looking for us. Finally they found us and we climbed out triumphantly. I wonder why we were not rewarded with slaps. Anyway, we played this game every now and then, and our tolerant family played along with us pretending to be panic-stricken. “Where are the children? Find them! Find them!” One day we went too far and the clasp slid off and the lid closed on us. This time when we shouted, no one heard us. Very soon, we launched genuine calls for help and when no one reached our room, we were really frightened. It was pitch dark inside the box. I am sure it was my brother who cried first but it might have been me. Luckily within minutes, the power of twin lungs brought mother and some guests to our rescue. We didn’t mind the thwacks that followed our rescue. At any rate, the “box” game was one we never played again.

At times, however, interaction with people around us throws up nuggets of practical wisdom.  My granddaughter, at the age of four, was at the dining table, listening intently to her father admonishing her. When he took a long pause, the child asked politely, “Daddy, if you have finished, may I say something?” You can call it the indulgence of a grandmother, but one had to admire her poise and patient listening even while being scolded. I compared her response with those of many adults who butt in, defend, shout, cry and do everything but listening and waiting for an appropriate time to put their own points across.  Another day, a neighbour saw my daughter returning from work and soon after, running with her child who was learning to ride a bicycle. The lady asked with genuine concern, “Hey, you just returned from work. Why don’t you rest for a while?” My daughter’s prompt reply was, “Aunty, it’s not her fault that I am working.”  My neighbour, a former colleague of mine, and I wondered if we had prioritised the needs of our children over professional commitments. I remembered waiting for my daughter to come from school, laying out lunch for her and trying to give her company. But quite often, I would feel exhausted and tell her to clear the table while I would rush off to sleep before returning to work for the afternoon. When I narrated this with a pang of guilt, my daughter reassured, “Mom, you actually showed that mothers have to do other things.” She expressed genuine empathy. Poise, patient listening, setting priorities and empathy may be inherent in some; if not, they can be developed through training and practice. But the ability to “forgive and forget” seems to be a rare trait and the lack of it leads to anger, revenge and ill feelings.

Have you seen  Season 2? Rain in December? So unseasonal! Can you pass me the pizza seasoning please?  The word “season” conjures up so many meanings and images in our mind. Just as there is a reason for everything, there is a season for everything as well. There are seasons for the use of words, names for newborns, superfood fads, workout routines and what-have-you! A season is a part of a year, marked by weather and daylight hours, influencing our life from availability of foodgrains, vegetables and fruits to wardrobes. Or it could imply a set or sequence of programmes. To season is to add salt, pepper or other spices to enhance the flavour of food or make wood suitable for use.  A season signifies a period when something is common or popular — or when something usually happens or is done. Activities, clocks and schedules change with seasons. People in cold climes turn back their clocks in summer to make better use of their time during the day. In the past, household chores for women used to vary a lot with the seasons. There was a season to purchase, clean, air out and store foodgrains for the whole year. Pickles were made for the year — mangoes in the summer, chillies in the winter. Mattresses were left under the April sun. This is changing rapidly, with the changing profile of Indian women and the availability of traditionally seasonal food and clothing throughout the year.

Launched with American non-profit Conservation International and multi-national investment company Goldman Sachs, Apple’s $200 million fund aims to remove at least one million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually from the atmosphere, equivalent to the amount of fuel used by over 2,00,000 passenger vehicles, while demonstrating a viable financial model that can help scale up investment in forest restoration.  Lisa Jackson, Apple’s Vice President of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, believes Nature provides some of the best tools to remove carbon from the atmosphere, in that forests, wetlands, and grasslands draw carbon from the atmosphere and store it away permanently in their soils, roots, and branches. She continues, “Through creating [the Restore Fund] that generates both a financial return as well as real, and measurable carbon impacts, we aim to drive broader change in the future — encouraging investment in carbon removal around the globe. Our hope is that others share our goals and contribute their resources to support and protect critical ecosystems.”  This effort is part of Apple’s broader goal to become carbon neutral across its entire value chain by 2030. While the company will directly eliminate 75% of emissions for its supply chain and products by 2030, the fund will help address the remaining 25% of Apple’s emissions by removing carbon from the atmosphere. Trees absorb carbon as they grow, with researchers estimating that tropical forests hold more carbon than humanity has emitted over the past 30 years from burning coal, oil, and natural gas, despite ongoing deforestation. The partnership aims to unlock the potential of this natural solution by scaling it in a way that makes it attractive to businesses.\"], ['2021/04/15', 'sci-tech', \"Bezos’ Blue Origin gets closer to human space flight with “astronaut rehearsal” - The Hindu Blue Origin's Audrey Powers sitting inside the crew capsule during 15th New Shepard mission's “astronaut rehearsal.”\\n\\xa0 | Photo Credit:    Jeff Bezos’ aerospace company, Blue Origin, successfully conducted an “astronaut rehearsal” during the company’s 15th New Shepard (NS-15) mission on April 14 from Launch Site One in West Texas.

Both those investigations were unable to determine what Mr. Kilimnik did with the data and whether he shared it further.

Mr. Lasso, a former banker who belongs to the centre-right Creating Opportunities (CREO) party, won 52.4% of the vote in the run-offs, defeating his opponent Andrez Arauz of the leftist Union of Hope coalition, who secured 47.7% despite leading in the first round with 32.7% over Mr. Lasso’s 19.7%. This was Mr. Lasso’ first presidential victory in three campaigns since 2013 but it did not come easily. In the first round, not only was his vote share some distance behind Mr. Arauz’s, but it was also barely more than that of third place candidate Yaku Perez of the indigenous coalition Pachakutik. Mr. Perez won 19.4% and fell short of second place by just 32,115 votes and went on to challenge the results. Both Mr. Aruaz and Mr. Perez’s coalitions belong to the left side of the political spectrum as opposed to Mr. Lasso’s centre-right and traditionalist platform, but there has been no love lost between the platforms that the former two politicians represent. Mr. Aruaz was the hand-picked nominee of popular ex-President Rafael Correa, who continues to exert a significant influence in Ecuador despite being out of power since 2017, living in Belgium. Mr. Correa’s coming to power in 2007 heralded the Ecuadorean version of the Latin American pink tide, a current that led to several left-wing parties winning power across the continent. Mr. Correa, a U.S. educated economist, reoriented government policy in Ecuador to effect redistribution and welfare, spending programmes that resulted in significant drops in poverty in the country. He also formed a radical trident of sorts in alliance with Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez and Bolivia’s Evo Morales by forming regional coalitions. Initially, Mr. Correa promised the recognition of rights and interests of the indigenous people, but they fell out with the government over issues such as the policies of mineral extraction from protected areas. With Mr. Correa using strong-arm measures to quell protests by indigenous groups during his tenure, a clear contradiction emerged between what some scholars call the politics of “left in power” defined by “Correismo” and “left in resistance” represented by Mr. Perez and other indigenous organisations. Mr. Perez called on his supporters to return invalid ballots instead of voting for either Mr. Arauz or Mr. Lasso and in the second round, nearly 18% of the ballots were indeed rendered invalid. This reduced the threshold for Mr. Lasso to win a majority of the remaining votes.  Besides, the fourth-placed candidate, Mr. Xavier Hervas of the “Democratic Left” party, a social democratic outfit that thrived in the old polity before Mr. Correa’s coming to power, also endorsed Mr. Lasso. In doing so, Mr. Hervas was privileging his opposition against Correismo — which liberals in Ecuador have identified as a “semi-authoritarian” tendency due to Mr. Correa’s run-ins with the judiciary and the media. But these steps by the other contenders do not suffice in explaining Mr. Lasso’s victory.'], ['2021/04/17', 'news', 'Our lands are under threat, say Tamils in Sri Lanka’s Eastern Province - The Hindu Sites such as the Kusalanamalai temple in Batticaloa district are increasingly under threat, say locals . Meera Srinivasan\\n\\xa0  Over the last few months, farmers of Mavadi Odai in Sri Lanka’s eastern Batticaloa district frequently spotted something crop up on their land overnight — a border stone they had not planted. “The Forest Department people come and put their stones when we are asleep, and then claim the land to be theirs,” says Marimuthu Raveendrakumar, 51, speaking of a growing insecurity among residents over land that they returned to only in recent years, after years of displacement during the civil war. According to many in Batticaloa, the land where Tamil communities have resided and farmed for generations, is increasingly under threat from different governmental bodies that oversee agriculture, conservation and archaeology. The 36 Tamil families in Mr. Raveendrakumar’s village which lacks motorable roads — it takes over 45 minutes to cover a 3-km stretch to reach here — do small-scale farming for a living.

The government’s forest conservation efforts come alongside growing criticism over its environmental policy that activists view as being “destructive”. Apart from tackling the Forest Department’s moves, the people of Mavadi Odai constantly dread wild elephants, and more recently, powerful humans eyeing their natural resources.

The organisation started by the late Khadim Hussain Rizvi often drew attention because of the controversial remarks made by its founder on social media and TV. In recent years, Pakistan saw a surge in the TLP’s activities, thanks to global developments and local opportunities. In an era of globalisation of information and diseases, a French school teacher’s lessons on freedom of expression provided a lifeline to the TLP, which has built a vast support network inside Pakistan based on its campaign against “blasphemy”. Samuel Paty, the middle-school teacher, showed his students the controversial cartoons on Prophet Muhammed that had appeared in the French satirical magazine  . His assertion of freedom attracted the wrath of a young Chechen who beheaded him on October 16, 2020. Subsequently, French President Emmanuel Macron hardened his position on Islamist extremism. As Mr. Macron attacked radical Islamists, Rizvi called on Pakistan to end its relationship with France, and summoned his Barelvi followers to flood the streets of Islamabad. But within days of calling for the protest, Rizvi succumbed to COVID-19. After his death, the organisation took a more militant turn under his son Saad Hussain Rizvi. To the outside world, the outrage against France expressed by a cleric may appear difficult to fathom but the Samuel Paty incident had touched upon the incendiary topic of blasphemy, which has the potential to stir up Pakistan’s politics. For several hardline Islamist groups in the country, the issue of blasphemy is above and beyond the state of Pakistan. For them, anyone who attempts to question what they believe the core tenet of Islam — respect for Prophet Muhammed and the unshakable recognition that the Prophet is the final messenger of the faith — should be punished with death. The TLP has been in the forefront of such groups.  The protest against blasphemy gave a foundational opportunity to the TLP when in 2010, Mumtaz Qadri, a bodyguard of the then Governor of Punjab Salman Taseer, shot him dead in the picturesque Kohsar Market of Islamabad. Taseer had finished his lunch in an Italian restaurant in the market and had emerged to sit in his vehicle when Qadri shot him in the back in point blank range. Taseer had championed the cause of Asiya Bibi, the Christian woman who was accused of blasphemy by the clerics. As the police arrested Qadri and produced him in court, the followers of Khadim Rizvi arrived with flowers that they showered on the killer. When the anti-blasphemy politics was growing in popularity in Pakistan, several religious leaders joined Rizvi to form a religious party which was named Tehreek-i-Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLYRA). They organised public events, calling for the release of Qadri.  In 2017, when Rizvi approached the Election Commission to register the new party, the Commission raised objections over its name. Then Rizvi announced the formation of the TLP as a political arm of the TLYRA. Within a few years, the TLP has grown to become one of the most powerful religious parties that have made blasphemy a key political issue.

Actor Vivekh, known by his moniker ‘Chinna Kalaivanar’, was the acknowledged heir to the legacy of N.S. Krishnan and M.R. Radha for using satire to highlight social problems. While he started out playing routine roles as a member of the hero’s gang of friends, Vivekh soon grew enough in the industry to be able to position himself as someone who supported social reform, rolling these messages into his tracks.  Writer Stalin Rajangam says Vivekh is part of the modern artistic tradition that believes in delivering social messages through art. “During the freedom movement and the Dravidian movement, the activists used plays to propagate social and political messages. Later, comedy and songs in films were used predominantly to turn focus on socio-political issues. Famous lyricist Pattukottai Kalyanasundaram is also a part of this tradition. Vivekh realised that there was a vacuum in the Tamil cinema during the 1990s and 2000s and adopted the techniques of M.R. Radha and N. S.

It was one that many schoolteachers and prefects avidly implemented in the 1950s and 1960s — perhaps a trifle too avidly for the comfort of their students. In fact, corporal punishment back then was the rule rather than the exception in most schools. In our all-boys residential school in Tiruchi in the 1950s, most teachers favoured the traditional “cuts” that left one with calloused and painful palms, wincing wryly — a cartoonist’s delight. And woe betide the boy who timidly withdrew his outstretched hand as the cane swished down viciously — sometimes resulting in the teacher flogging himself. The hapless lad would then receive a thrashing on his legs, leaving him hopping around like a demented dervish! Our stern prefect, a stickler for discipline, was feared for his dreaded “three of the best”, as he menacingly put it, administered with a swishy cane. If one wasn’t well cushioned anatomically, the flogging left one with a tender fundament, fervently vowing never to be naughty again. Such was its deterrent effect. A peremptory summons from the principal was enough to make us quail. One wondered with trepidation whether someone had squealed about the pin one had sadistically planted in a classroom bench — business end up! Or had the principal, while prowling the corridors of the school, seen one playing pranks behind the teacher’s back?

One got one’s deserts swiftly — with a rattan cane that had “tanned many a hide” to use our schoolboy parlance. And one usually returned with a pronounced limp, one’s trotters having borne the brunt. The “ear-screw” was quite popular with some teachers. Irked by stupidity or perversity, they would latch on to one’s ear like a limpet, tweaking it hard as if trying to free it from its moorings. Or, worse, they would try to hoist a student by his ear, forcing him to “levitate” — rise on tiptoe as far as possible to prevent his flapper being yanked out.

This is in no way a critique of using hard data to drive policy and business decisions, but the over-reliance on data (that can be skewed), the lack of human touch narratives and dialogue with stakeholders, particularly the beneficiaries, is the very reason that social welfare policies do not have the intended impact. There are drastic consequences when human beings are stripped off their identities and idiosyncrasies and simply become data points and it is certainly repugnant that the big tech companies of Silicon Valley perceive users as “interchangeable little neurons in a global super brain, no one of which is important” (Jaron Lanier,  ). Perhaps as a marker of the finality of transitioning into adulthood, I find free-floating shapes and figures shifting, in the largely unimaginative world of grown-ups, to form concrete blocks. Robin Williams, in the movie, identifies that mainstream society chooses to underplay the importance of art, sidelines it to favour the more “serious” vocations and blatantly dismisses art as an ancillary activity, something to be done at leisure, when one has completed the day’s toil.  The movie came out in 1989 (coincidentally, the same year the Microsoft Office suite was launched) and Keating’s lament on the perceived unimportance of creative pursuits is still relevant. What is hypocritical about downplaying the essentiality of art is that art, in its many forms, is constantly devoured by society. Music videos, films and books provided a lifeline and prevented many from falling off the deep end in the pandemic-induced mental distress last year. And yet it is hard to drive home to everyone the notion that art is essential and is at the core of our being, and while we could do away with Excel sheets and PowerPoint presentations, we can never do away with art, because art is an expression of who we are and in creating it or in revelling in it as an audience, we find that we are connected in ways we cannot imagine, that it is the same existential angst that the protagonist of the novel faced that you once faced, or similar line of thought that you share with the filmmaker.

Its literal meaning in Latin is crab, probably named so for the tendency of some cancers to have visible finger-like projections resembling the limbs of a crab, but it also applies to the ability of these groups of diseases to have a crab-like hold on the patient and be resistant to the then available treatments.  While modern medicine has done much to loosen the crab’s grip on patients to the extent that many common cancers are now curable if detected early, the grip that the word “cancer” has on the common person’s psyche is as strong as ever. Perhaps the most intimidating is “brain cancer”. Brain cancers, or technically neoplasms/tumours of the brain, are a large heterogeneous group of diseases that have more differences than similarities between them except for the fact that they occur inside the skull. The most common brain tumours are gliomas, which originate from the brain tissue  , meningiomas, which arise from the coverings of the brain, and pituitary adenomas, which arise from the pituitary gland. The unique thing about tumours in the brain in comparison to other parts of the body is that the symptoms caused are a combination of the physical presence of tumour and the compression of the part of the brain most adjacent to it. Thus a tumour located in the right half of the brain at or near the part that controls movements of the left half of body causes weakness of the left arm and leg, a tumour near the speech area can cause alteration of speech patterns which might either increase or decrease fluency of speech and a tumour near the visual apparatus can cause disturbances in vision such that the patient feels a curtain is drawn over part of his or her eye.  The downside of this is that sometimes tumours grow to a large extent before they become symptomatic because the part of the brain that they are pressing on has functions whose absence is not readily detected.

In fact, that is precisely why I start the book with that, because it seems to me that because we're the only subcontinent, we are part of a larger continent and we're aware of that. But we also have a very strong sense of our own exceptionalism, of our uniqueness, of how different we are. Therefore there's always a tendency to actually draw down the shutters, withdraw to our own home. That's the main point of the book actually, because that worries me, the fact that I think we have something of that withdrawing going on right now. For me, the lesson of our history and experience since Independence is that India does best the more connected she is with the rest of the world, the more engaged she is with the rest of the world. That is proven, right through history over and over again. It is those parts of India which were connected to the world through the Indian Ocean, the whole east coast of India, the Coromandel coast, all the way up to Bengal, and the west coast, Malabar, all the way up to the Gujarat coast, that were the most advanced economically, the most prosperous, the most stable core areas in terms of civilisation and culture, and the ones most in touch with the rest of the world for the last 3000 years or more. For me, that’s the important lesson that I drove from our geography, because, as you said, with this strong sense of exceptionalism when things get tough outside, it's easy to say, ‘forget the world’. Self-reliance can tend to become autarky, and that's where I think there is danger. The book is actually a plea for engagement with the world, even though things have got very tough when you look at the global economy, geopolitics, etc. I think that is because we had a vision of ourselves, of our own role, of our place in the world, our place in world civilisation. That actually prevented us from choosing short-term maximalist solutions, as most politicians would. In fact, in some ways, it helped that we had a vision. It helped us to overcome the limitations of capacity and capability, of a very difficult bipolar Cold War world which was being formed at that time. And it enabled us because we had this sense of who we were and of our own interest, and got our priorities right.\"], ['2021/04/23', 'news', 'Russia’s Navalny to end prison hunger strike on 24th day - The Hindu Alexei Navalny.

For over 20 years, it has seen intense collaboration between the U.S., Russia, the EU, Japan and Canada, and has played host to people from 19 countries since its launch in 1998. This scenario appears to be coming to an end, as Russian space agency Roscosmos’s chief has declared that Russia is ready to build its own space station and launch it by 2030 if President Vladimir Putin would give the go ahead. Further, in an interview to Russian TV, Deputy Prime minister Yuri Borisov said Russia would give notice and leave the ISS by 2025.  The idea of the ISS was born in 1984 when Ronald Reagan, then the US President, announced it in a State of the Union address. “Our progress in space, taking giant steps for all mankind, is a tribute to American teamwork and excellence. Our finest minds in government, industry and academia have all pulled together. And we can be proud to say: We are first; we are the best; and we are so because we're free,” he said. In his speech, he outlined the idea of international cooperation in this venture, as he announced: “A space station will permit quantum leaps in our research in science, communications, and in metals and lifesaving medicines which could be manufactured only in space. We want our friends to help us meet these challenges and share in their benefits. NASA will invite other countries to participate so we can strengthen peace, build prosperity, and expand freedom for all who share our goals.” Since then, the ISS project saw a collaboration grow between several countries, mainly the following space agencies: NASA (U.S.), Roscosmos (Russia), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan) and CSA (Canada). Though the programme began in 1993, the construction of the station started only in 1998.  The ISS has been assembled section by section over several years. The first segment was launched on November 20, 1998 in a Russian proton rocket named Zarya (which means ‘sunrise’). The first human expedition to the station was launched in a Soyuz TM 31 rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. This crew became the very first to inhabit the ISS — these were NASA astronaut Bill Shepard and Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev from Roscosmos, who reached the station on November 2, 2000 and stayed for several months.  The assembling of the ISS has been a complex undertaking in itself. It took over 10 years and over 30 missions to bring it to its present form. Though the basic unit was launched in 1998, a photograph of the station taken in September 2000 from spaceship Atlantis looked markedly different from a picture taken in October 2018 by Expedition 56 members after undocking in a Soyuz spacecraft. Installation of different parts took place on close to 40 different occasions from 1998 to 2020.  One of the most spectacular achievements of the ISS is that ever since November 2, 2000, it has seen the steady presence of human beings. So far, 240 individuals from 19 countries have visited the ISS, including from Malaysia and the UAE. Most have been from the U.S., numbering 151; Russia has sent 48 people; Japan 9; Canada 8 and so on. In the realm of science fiction, the sight of the ISS hurtling through space at a speed of 28,000 km per hour is something that can be watched from the Earth and wondered at. According to Niruj Mohan Ramanujan, a radio-astronomer who is with Indian Institute of Astrophysics, “If the ISS flies over your location a bit before sunrise or a bit after sunset, for those few minutes, it is usually the brightest object in the sky.” There are apps that indicate where exactly it is in the sky at any time. \"], ['2021/04/24', 'news', 'Help countries like India and Brazil hit by COVID-19: U.S. Chamber of Commerce - The Hindu A woman receives the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine, at the Catete Palace in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil April 23, 2021. \\xa0 | Photo Credit:    The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a powerful trade body, added its name to the  – such as India – address their vaccine shortages. “As the pandemic inflicts a heavy toll on countries around the globe, the U.S. Chamber strongly encourages the administration to release the millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses in storage — as well as other life-saving support — for shipment to India, Brazil, and other nations hard-hit by the pandemic,” Myron Brilliant, Chamber’s Executive VP said in a statement released on Friday.

Palestinians have clashed with Israeli police on a nightly basis since the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramzan. The tensions began when police placed barricades outside the Old City's Damascus Gate, where Muslims traditionally gather to enjoy the evening after the daytime fast.

Gone are the days when simple things could bring about a smile easily. A scented eraser, a super-hero themed pencil, a brand new sticky tattoo would all make us super-stars in our class and that was the ultimate bliss we enjoyed. Waiting for our favourite song to be played on radio, or a new film to be broadcast in TV taught us to be patient and savour the fruits of waiting with everyone in the family. Jukebox and Medley used to be our YouTube, and getting our calls connected and picking the favourite song within the time-limit was the ultimate test those days. Power cuts used to be the most awaited event, when everyone in the family would sit together outside, enjoy the cool breeze and talk about everything under the sun. It was also the best part as my sister and I would continuously gaze at the sky hoping to catch a passing meteor that could fulfil our wishes. It used to be a ‘on top of the world’ feeling to get a call from a friend those days. During weekday nights, every time the phone rang, we would keep our fingers crossed, hoping it would be a friend calling to clear doubts. If so, it would make our heads go high in pride, as it used to give us a nerdy feeling. Things have changed so much these days. We keep hunting for joy making our lives complicated, not realising that simple things can also bring a smile. We have too many options for everything that it leaves us confused. Getting a chocolate for a child has itself become very hectic, with so many varieties around. Earlier a simple Poppins was enough to delight a child, but nowadays kids do not settle for such simple delights. Friends no longer talk to each other. They prefer to text and rely on emojis to convey their feelings. There’s no more family time these days.

The house, constructed almost 20 years ago, was small, and when we felt the need for a larger accommodation, the easiest way out was building additional rooms. The towering jackfruit tree that stood canopying the small property I inherited in my ancestral village was the answer to all the requirements of wood. The suggestion from the well-wisher appeared tempting because the price of timber these days is too exorbitant. I took one last long look at the majestic tree that had really grown old with rough grey-brown barks peeling off around its trunk. As the tree-cutter went up, a couple of owls, shocked out of their slumber, flew away loudly flapping their wings. Just as the man started to chop its ancient branches, I saw crows wildly wailing around and some pigeons flying helter-skelter. Probably they were out searching for food, and the word about the intruder spread. I soon realised that the flutter high above was a sign of extreme distress. The violent avian protest against felling the tree — their home for generations, where they might have nestled, brooded, and hatched — continued for some time and then reluctantly fizzled out.  The trunk was cut into different sizes and transported to a sawmill near my home. When I noticed the shrieking head-saw coming to a sudden halt and the workmen examining something, I approached them. “Sir, it is a tree frog. He has been hiding in the tree hollow all the way.” The poor greenish frog was cut right through the middle; one piece lying on the ground covered in sawdust and the other half still embedded in the cavity, one of its little paws still stretching out. The work on the wood soon resumed, but my thoughts were already muddled. I would only state that the thought of building our happy home over such agonies and tortures started giving me the jitters. I had never imagined that by cutting an old jackfruit tree, I would be destroying so many joyful habitats. I didn’t discuss these things with my family lest I could become a spoiler to the celebratory mood in our refurbished home, but the elephant in my mind simply refused to move away. One evening, I silently skipped off to my village and planted a jackfruit sapling at “the ground zero”, even as the twilight void and emptiness left behind by the giant tree stared at me. I gently watered the sprout and carefully placed a tree guard around it. The drying stump of the old tree would remain there for some more time as an uneasy reminder of my brazen act. The little sapling may survive the vagaries of seasons, and one day, thick foliage will crown its top inviting tweets and chirps.

By and large, humankind, irrespective of their nationality and culture talk or think mostly about their problems. This habit ruins time, peace of mind, health and relationships. Its easier to mention “Talk about your joys” than practising it in day-to-day life. It’s more so with life’s uncertainties due to COVID-19. The issue is we not only forget our joyful moments, rather we encounter problems in identifying those small “joys” of life! As we are overwhelmed with the thought process of not so happy moments, we used to wait for things to get better. How to identify, choose and cherish those joyful moments? The key is to look for opportunities (however minute it is) of happiness in the present moment we are in right now. Don’t wait for things to get easier, simpler, better. Life will always be complicated. Look for small opportunities for happiness in the moment you are in right now. Otherwise, you might run out of time. We cannot control our circumstances, but we can replace our reactions and emotions with better responses. Right now is the only moment any of us is guaranteed. Take a deep breath and look around right now. Your life, your happiness is here in the now. Slow down and stop chasing happiness in the future. It is here in the present moment. Feel the experiences of life in the “here and now”. Stop focusing on big events — vacation plans, holidays, weekend plans — and start looking for joy in the small moments that happen in everyday life. Appreciate some of the simple pleasures of life. Enjoy the little things like the smell of freshly ground coffee, joy of reading a good book, a quiet walk in the woods, or a chance to connect with your family while you make dinner. Gratitude for the simple beauty found within “the everyday” brings joy. Listening and watching little ones bring in immense joy. Taking a walk, doing an exercise routine, yoga and meditation will bring in joy for sure. Smiling brings us joy and keeps us in the present. Whether it’s on your own face or someone else’s, a smile has a contagious quality about it. Scientists call it facial mimicry and it has been linked to influencing emotions in others as well as in yourself. There is definitely a mind-body connection. So when you find yourself to be swallowed up by negativity or frustration, force yourself to smile and feel that smile. Smiling helps shift your mood when necessary. It helps you feel joy more often.'], ['2021/04/25', 'opinion', 'Why do we follow cricket? - The Hindu My earliest memory of cricket goes back to the three Test series that India played in Pakistan in 1978. It was an iconic series, perhaps the first time, we had live telecast of the matches on TV. I was too young to understand the nuances of the game. But the black and white images of Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, Zaheer Abbas and Imran Khan have not faded one bit. What began with this series is a love affair with cricket that continues to this day.  Cricket folklore passed on from generation to generation ensures that even heroes of a distant past, rub shoulders with the stars of today. That way, cricket memory has no beginning. Through the tales told and retold by my grandfather and father, both cricket freaks, the embers of cricket of an earlier era continue to burn bright. Mankad and Merchant, Pataudi and Chandra may have left the cricket arena well before my time, but it was as though, I saw them bat and bowl right in front of my eyes.  For a cricket enthusiast, it is not just a game. We play out our life, against the backdrop of cricket. Each of life’s flag-post events is matched up with a corresponding event in cricket and vice versa. When my daughter was born, I was as much excited about her arrival as about Sehwag getting to his triple hundred. And when it comes to cricket’s crowning moments, we know exactly where we were, and what we were doing on that day. Dhoni and team may have won the World Cup, but we held the trophy in our hands standing in the apartment balcony.  We are often asked why we follow cricket so closely. We may have played the game in childhood and derived some fun out of it. We do not actively play anymore. What is the point in following the sport so closely, investing so much time and mind-share? A cricket nut struggles to answer. He can only mumble incoherently — it is like love, it has no logic. There is a sense of inevitability to it. Why do we follow cricket? It is for the sheer excitement of looking forward to something. We know after the IPL is over, India will spend the summer in England, followed by the T20 World Cup. The carpet is already laid out for the entire year. The thrill is in the wait, in the anticipation for the next cricket event to unfold and then the next, ad infinitum. Without this, life will be too drab, robbed of all fizz.  In following cricket, we ride a roller-coaster of emotion. When India was all out for 36 in Australia, it was a personal embarrassment. We sulked in silence; we could not show our face outside. Family members consoled us, “Why are you moving around with such a long face, as if some grave calamity has befallen you? Look! Even the cricketers have forgotten about it!” And then, when India won the next Test, the happiness couldn’t be contained. There was a new spring in the steps, cheer on the face and even this corona-ridden world, seemed the happiest place in the universe! Such is cricket!

When all of his friends and family left Afghanistan as the country fell from one crisis to another, he stayed. But now, with the U.S. troops withdrawing from Afghanistan and the fear of the Taliban’s second coming rising, Zabulon Simentov, Afghanistan’s one-man Jewish community, is preparing to leave the country for Israel. “After our important festivals [Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur in September], I will leave Afghanistan,” he told Radio Free Afghanistan recently. “If the Taliban return, they are going to push us out with a slap in the face.” Born in the 1950s in Herat when Afghanistan was ruled by King Mohammed Zahir Shah, Mr. Simentov’s story is that of persecution, exodus and patriotism. A carpet merchant who had served in the Afghan army, Mr. Simentov left the country briefly in the 1990s when the country was gripped by sectarian violence, but returned against all advice from friends and family. His wife, two daughters and sisters all live in Israel. In 2013, when he was asked by a journalist if he wanted to go to Israel, he said, “What do I want in Israel? This is my home. This is where I belong.” For nearly 16 years, he has been the only known Jew in Afghanistan. He lived alone in Kabul’s Flower Street, next to the city’s lone synagogue. He read Torah alone from the pulpit of the synagogue. And he made his own kosher meat.  The tale of Jews in Afghanistan is one of the many tragedies of the country. Afghanistan’s links with Judaism go back in at least 1,500 years. One of the legends about the origins of the Pashtuns, the dominant ethnic group in the country, is that they were the offspring of a lost tribe of Israel. The country had some 40,000-strong Jewish community in the mid-20th century, mostly in Herat, Mr. Simentov’s home region. The monarchical rule, which lasted till 1973, was a “golden period” for the country’s Jews, according to Mr. Simentov. When Israel was created in 1948, many Jews left Afghanistan. The exodus continued in the 1980s, following the 1979 Soviet intervention. Most of the remaining Jewish families left the country during the mujahideen fighting when tribal Islamist militias fought, with help from the U.S., Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, both the Soviets and the Communist rulers in Kabul. By the early 1990s, when the communist government of Mohammed Najibullah was battling for its survival, there were hardly 15 Jews left in Kabul. They would also leave during the civil war that followed the fall of Najibullah.  During the Taliban regime, two men made up the country’s Jewish community — Mr. Simentov and Isaac Levy. They lived in the synagogue compound in Kabul, but hardly got along. They accused each other of violating the tenets of Judaism. Levy said Mr. Simentov was trying to send him off to Israel so that he could take over the synagogue. Mr. Simentov said he was concerned about Levy’s health. Their infighting caused a headache even for the Taliban’s anti-minority regime.The Taliban police arrested them. Levy died in 2005. And since then, Mr. Simentov and the synagogue have been the last vestiges of Judaism in Afghanistan. If he leaves for Israel later this year, the synagogue would likely be closed, bringing an end to the country’s centuries-long relationship with Judaism. When the Taliban were in power, Mr. Simentov said later, he was offered money to convert to Islam. “I made them a counter-offer to convert to Judaism,” he said. He lost the synagogue’s most important possession, a 15th century Torah, when the Taliban were in power. He blamed the Taliban for the loss. The Taliban’s 1996-2001 rule was infamous for the persecution of religious minorities and women. Many of them, especially Hindus and Sikhs, fled to India. After the fall of the Taliban, Afghanistan adopted a Constitution that offered equal rights and government protection to the minorities. But the situation on the ground remained grim, and with the rise of the Islamic State in Afghanistan that targets minorities and the prospect of the return of the Taliban, many started fleeing the country in recent months.  “Peace talks are making people worried that if the Taliban come and if they behave the same as they used to during their regime then people will be worried,” Mr. Simentov said in 2019. His fears are coming true. The U.S. signed an agreement with the Taliban in February 2020 as part of which American troops were scheduled to leave Afghanistan by May 1. President Joe Biden delayed the pullout to September 11. And after September, many fear that the Taliban could make rapid advances on the battleground. Mr. Simentov is not staying back to see that. “I will watch on TV in Israel to find out what will happen in Afghanistan,” he says.

It is likely to increase to 60,000 during the peak. This centre will help us manage the peak,” he said.

I asked him what happened, and he said it was a case of crossing of a goods train and a Mail on a single track. He gave clearance to receive the goods train first, but it took unusually long to arrive and delayed the departure of the Mail. In those days, without any centralised traffic control, it was those men on the lines who kept trains running and on their judgment depended the safety and comfort of passengers.

He joined the old South Indian Railway just after his matriculation results when he was all of 18. His marks were good and the Railways’ offer came too soon. He put aside the thoughts of further studies and joined as a rookie stationmaster. It was also a desire on his part not to burden my grandfather financially.  His first posting was at Manamadurai Junction in Tamil Nadu and after duty hours, he slept on running boxes because the British-owned SIR did not provide accommodation to probationary stationmasters. The SIR was spread out in the most arid regions of southern Tamil Nadu with just a branch line to Kerala, and in many stations, it was difficult to get drinking water, which was supplied by passing trains.  Yet, he and my mother spent their young lives in places such as Vayyampetti, Devakottai Road, Kulathur, Dindigul and Sivakasi, all dusty, dry places.

Testicular cancer is one such, predominantly affecting younger men. There is a lack of awareness leading to delayed diagnosis and the cancer reaching an advanced stage compromising survival.  Testicular cancer affects the testicles, the male reproductive organs responsible for producing sperms and the masculinising hormone called testosterone. It predominantly affects men in the 15-35 age group and it is the commonest solid cancer among them. The crude incidence rate is 1 per 100,000 population as per the Madras Metropolitan Cancer Registry at the Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, Chennai.  There are no known causes. However, a history of undescended testis and testicular cancer in a first degree relative predisposes one to testicular cancer. Testicular cancer survivors are also at increased risk of a second primary cancer in the opposite testicle. It is not a communicable disease, and there is no way to prevent the occurrence of testicular cancer; thus, awareness of this cancer and early detection is crucial.  It usually presents as a painless enlarging lump of the testis. It may also present as pain or a dragging sensation over the scrotum. Rarely it may also present with symptoms suggestive of metastasis (cancer spread elsewhere) such as fatigue, backache or breathlessness. Evaluation includes performing tests such as an ultrasound of both testes, a CT scan of the abdomen and chest and blood tests to look for increase in markers such as alpha-feto protein, beta C and LDH. Final confirmation is by removal of testis which is both diagnostic and curative (in very early stages). Testicular cancers can broadly be divided into seminomatous and non-seminomatous — these differ in treatment protocols. Treatment involves removal of the involved testicle by a procedure known as high inguinal orchidectomy. This is followed by chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery (retroperitoneal lymph node dissection or RPLND) depending on the type of cancer and stage of the disease. With advances in science, testicular cancer treatment has excellent outcomes. The five-year survival, if detected in the early stages, can be in excess of 95%. Most patients can have healthy sexual relations despite removal of one testis. The cancer or treatment may lead to infertility, and hence sperm banking is an option to preserve fertility.'], ['2021/05/02', 'opinion', 'Dialling in to memories - The Hindu I was pleasantly surprised when during a session of spring cleaning, my father handed me an old telephone diary from my school days. Distant memories of idyllic days flashed by as I saw some of my old friends’ phone numbers, addresses, and birthdays written in alphabetical order in my childish yet neat cursive handwriting. Today’s mobile phones have rendered the phone diary useless. But when I was growing up, the bulky telephone directory, which could easily double up as a dumbbell, was the lifeline of the family. It took a lot of effort to locate someone’s coordinates but once you managed to persevere, the results were rewarding.  We also had a regal-looking telephone diary, covered in brown leather, that saw us through thick and thin and was easily our family’s most important piece of “literature”. From everyday names to emergency contacts for the times when my parents travelled for their medical conferences, the brown diary knew it all. This diary was also one of my earliest forms of personal space, when I got a whole page to myself upon starting primary school. I was deemed too young to have my own room that time and shared one with my sister. Our brown phone diary was privy to all our secrets and conversations and did not mind the least when we scribbled numbers and drew doodles on it with ink pens, ball pens, sketch pens, colour pencils, and even lipstick when nothing better could be found during an important phone call. In many ways, our phone directory gave me my first lessons in paying attention to detail when I found several phone numbers without any names against them, clearly written in haste during a phone call. This often led to chaos and many an embarrassing “sorry, wrong number” conversation when my parents were unable to find the correct phone number they wanted to dial in. Today, our telephone directories are with us wherever we go thanks to our phones. We can store addresses, birthdays, anniversaries, and voice notes for all our contacts now. I even save my contacts’ photos with the names given how bad I am at putting faces and names together. No doubt, technology has been helpful, but future generations will never get the lessons in keeping records and managing space that we got from our phone diaries and directories. And they shall certainly not know the simple pleasure of stumbling across an old telephone diary that brings to life memories of a childhood after decades.

While BJP candidate Thuravur Vishwambaran garnered 29,843 votes in 2016, it dropped by 6,087 votes to 23,756 this time despite the party fielding a reputed academic like K.S. Radhakrishnan. Mr. Radhakrishnan had predicted 60,000 votes and victory, but ended up far from it. That the difference in BJP’s vote share is nearly five times more than the slender lead of 992 votes by which the UDF candidate K. Babu defeated the Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate M. Swaraj has triggered allegations of vote trading between the BJP and the UDF. Mr. Swaraj said the result had vindicated his observations before the election of “an unholy nexus between the BJP and the UDF”. “In our post-election analysis, we had anticipated a vote trade in excess of 5,000 votes but had hoped to overcome it. This trading of votes will be debated in the State politically and people will realise the truth of the matter. Whatever be the case, secularism will eventually prevail,” said Mr. Swaraj, adding that the matter would closely be looked into. Incidentally, soon after his candidature, Mr. Babu had openly declared that he would get BJP votes. That statement was used to target Mr. Babu by rival A.B.

The post-election review meeting held by the UDF had unanimously passed a resolution seeking the ouster of Mr. Sabu on account of his public statements. On the eve of the election, posters in the name of Sabarimala Karma Samithi had appeared across the constituency that exhorted people not to vote for the BJP to defeat the LDF.

A few weeks ago, I, along with my sister, reached the government hospital for the injection. Disregarding all plausible negative news and views, we reached the vaccination centre, but to our utter disappointment, were informed that the hospital had run out of vaccines. I was quite astonished because a month ago even many health workers expressed their reluctance to be jabbed after getting their names registered for vaccination.  However, people’s soaring enthusiasm for vaccination apparently caused by the apprehension of a second wave of the pandemic enhanced my confidence and made me an ardent vaccine taker. We went to another vaccination centre on the municipality premises. Fortunately, we got the chance to be vaccinated in place of a couple of absentees who had enlisted their names early in the morning but failed to turn up. A sullen-faced clerk who was checking the Aadhaar cards as age proof beckoned us to sit and wait in the chairs in the long, narrow antechamber.  In the meantime, the clerk was entangled in a debate with a person already vaccinated with the first dose 28 days ago. The man wanted to be jabbed for the second time on the due date mentioned in his vaccination slip. But the young clerk was trying to convince him that the gap between vaccine doses had been revised to four to eight weeks. Their loud dispute necessitated the intervention of a senior medic. A sinister silence fell on the vaccination centre as if a hushed-up business had been going on. The narrow room became congested gradually as most of the persons were waiting about 30 minutes or more after vaccination to be kept under observation. However, there was nobody to monitor the vaccinated persons. At last, I felt serendipitous when our turn came. We got vaccinated.  While waiting, I came across a medical officer of my personal acquaintance who happened to arrive in the centre to supervise the overall vaccination programme. As I had already been vaccinated with the first dose, I could not restrain my inquisitiveness to ask a series of questions about the vaccination to cast off the confusion that clouded my thoughts. When I wanted to know if the vaccine would provide long-term protection, he informed me that as the matter was under research, it was too early to say the duration of protection.

Last week, I visited my family friend to enquire about his daughter’s wedding, proposed a few months ago but postponed because of COVID-19. After removing the mask and sanitising my hands, we exchanged greetings and pleasantries.  The conversation commenced with the present nationwide concern over the pandemic, which gradually reduced its virulence by 2020-end but has now come back as a second wave with a vengeance. We discussed at length what could be the possible reasons for this second hit, freely using terminologies such as variants of concern and mutation but with only a partial understanding of the science behind it. Realising soon that an in-depth analysis is beyond our comprehension, we came to the purpose of our meeting that day.  “I feel that we need not delay the marriage of your daughter any further. Let us fix an auspicious day very soon and go ahead with the celebration, strictly following the prescribed restrictions,” I said. “To be very much within the safe limit, let the invitees be limited to much fewer than hundred. Hope I don’t sound too much cautious. Today’s technology has enabled us to witness any event live. In the coming days, for marriage celebrations also, this may become a common practice. After the situation returns to normal, soon, the couple can leisurely visit the families which could not attend the function, at mutually convenient times and seek their greetings in person.”  Are not our children getting used to the online mode of learning and writing examinations? Of course, it is also true that it is not a 100% effective substitute for regular classroom learning and understanding of the subjects.

Google tells me that there are more than 3 lakh autos in the city.  When the autorickshaws started plying in 1959, the citizens of then Bangalore felt elated by the new mode of transport, which could accommodate three passengers at a time. In the beginning petrol-driven autos arrived followed by those running on diesel and later LPG. As regards the behaviour of auto drivers, some are very polite, and some arrogant; yet another category is very cordial and courteous to the aged.  In recent times, we saw the entry of women drivers. No doubt, a welcome change.  I have had several bad and interesting experiences during auto rides . On a Sunday morning, I wanted to go to N.R. Colony to meet my cousin who had just recovered from an illness. As usual, I stood near my house looking for an auto. While one passed me, the driver told me to wait and after some time, promptly came back to pick me. I got into it and reached my destination in hardly 10 minutes. When I was about to give the fare, he started telling me, “Sir, I have a son and a daughter studying in college. I have to pay college fees.” He pulled out a bundle of notes from his pocket, to impress me about his need for more money. I gave him the minimum fare and an additional ₹200. I asked his name and noted down the auto number just for records. I didn’t disclose this incident to anybody.  A couple of days later, my wife hired an auto to visit somebody in Chamarajpet. The driver readily obliged to take her to the destination. But, on the way, near Uma Talkies on B.T. Road, a traffic policeman stopped the auto and asked the driver, “Why are you not wearing the uniform?” Somehow, for his luck, the signal turned to green, and the auto zoomed away. The driver told my wife that his son was in need of money to pay the college fees. My wife, after a patient hearing, paid the fare. But the nagging driver pestered her to help him. My wife excused herself saying, “You come to my house with the ID card of your son. Promptly, the next day the driver arrived and stood before us. As soon as he saw me, he started behaving like a stranger. I recognised him and asked him, “Are you not the driver who took me to N.R. Colony recently.” He was stunned. His modus operandi was exposed. He gave evasive answers for not showing the ID card. On humanitarian grounds, we gave him ₹200. An auto once came very near to the kerb of the footpath, and the driver started a conversation. “Hello, are you not my classmate? Get in, I will drop you near your house.” He did so. But after parting with ₹200, I realised I was fooled.

The fascination for betel leaf extends across the country — from Banaras to Belur, from Baroda to Bongaigaon! There is no doubt, that this betel leaf preparation is India’s favourite delicacy. Every street corner has its little paan shop.  The paan-wala in the northern parts of India has a regal presence. There is a fragrance that hangs around him. His compact shop is packed with varieties of betel leaves, dozens of silver containers and copper pots. Wiping his hands off his red rag cloth, he is truly an artist, as he gets to work. His canvas is the green betel leaf. He coats it with a calcium paste in white, adds a liquid in brown, and then, mixes the colours to a light pastel shade. His nimble fingers now get into action — a dash of powder from one container, a sprinkle of coconut filings from another and a shake from another dispenser. He tops it with a spoonful of rose-petal paste, a pod of cardamom, folds the betel leaf in a triangle and hands it out in style. For special customers, he has an ice box filled with customized, frozen paan, the betel leaf embossed with a silver foil and with a cherry-top toothpick to hold the leaf together. Who can resist this indulgence?  The South Indian betel leaf is slightly different. It is smaller, greener and spicier in taste. There are not as many paan-shops in South India, but the fixation for the delicacy is no less. In earlier times, bus journeys were a great opportunity to observe betel-leaf aficionados who sat beside and indulged in the pastime. Much like the cellphone is an integral part of a person today, in those days, it was the compact, silver betel-nut case. Open the case, and it was stacked with sheaves of betel leaves. The indulgent carefully pulled out a couple of leaves, shook off the water droplets and peeled off the tiny leaf-stalk. His fingers dug out some slaked-lime paste from a side-compartment. He finger-painted the betel-leaf and topped it with a sprinkling of fragrant betel-nut flakes. He meticulously rolled it up in a bun, and even as we watched curiously, popped it into the mouth. With the betel leaf tucked in a ball to one side of his cheek, he was a changed personality! The irritation that accompanied the long, arduous bus journey was gone. His face exuded an indescribable calm and happiness. He was at peace with himself and with the world at large!  Betel leaves have a prominent presence in South Indian weddings. They are given a prime place in the wedding hall with a table specially reserved for this. The betel leaves are arranged on a silver tray with the accompaniments: packets of aromatic betel nut crushed powder, areca nut sliced flakes and a bowlful of sugar crystal. By mid-day, the hoopla of the wedding celebration comes to a close and the hall empties out. The blazing sun outside, the coolness of the hall, the satiation following a full wedding-meal, all combine to keep the last few guests still lingering in the hall. They laze around the hall to catch a quick, afternoon siesta and then reach out for the betel-leaves. As they work on the betel leaves in the mouth, it is best to avoid conversation. Betel leaves and conversation do not go together. Much as we would like to know if they need a ride back home or a cup of coffee, we get no proper answers. The lips are stained a bright red and the juices threaten to overflow the sides of the mouth. All they can do is nod, mumble and gurgle incoherently. We leave them to complete their rumination!

Rejections troubled me. I felt dejected. I even considered quitting. But being a fighter, I introspected and realised I would have to learn how to write the content wanted by publications. The difference in cultures was unbridgeable. The decision to write on health and help others understand disease took root. In October 2020, while COVID-19 raged, I enrolled for a certified course in health writing, working diligently on every assignment.

We call it the mainstream smoke. In contrast, 85% of the smoke produced by a cigarette is generated while it is passively burning: the sidestream smoke. Surprisingly, the sidestream smoke emits toxic chemicals such as 2-napthylamine, N-nitroso-diethyamine, 4-aminobiphenyl and carbon monoxide, in concentrations higher than the mainstream smoke, making it more dangerous.

And Pallium India, a non-Governmental organisation headquartered in Thiruvananthapuram, is helping them overcome the numbing grief with the help of Sukh-Dukh, a helpline that provides counselling in eight Indian languages. “What we are seeing now is a kind of pathological grief as a result of the sudden passing away of a loved one. There are three reasons for this. The demise of anyone close to us causes grief. Most of us gradually, with time, accept it and move forward. However, when the death is sudden, like in an accident, the survivors might take a longer time to accept the loss. The pandemic has resulted in many such deaths and caused certain people to go into pathological grief,” explains Dr MR Rajagopal, founder and chairman of Pallium India. Another reason for the spiralling grief is the inability to conduct any funeral rituals for the deceased as COVID-19 protocol proscribes any contact with the body. “Often, these rituals bring a kind of closure and emotional and psychological relief for the bereaved. The lack of such gestures can aggravate the grief, which can sometimes lead to clinical depression,” says Dr Rajagopal.  Thirdly, as a result of the need for social distancing, the bereaved are often left without the support of relatives or friends. “Usually, in India, relatives and neighbours come to the help of bereaved families. Sharing of memories about the deceased person, conversations and the presence of relatives provide a healing touch.

The seventh census, released on Tuesday by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Beijing, noted 12 million babies were born last year, the lowest number since 1961, a year when China was in the midst of a four-year famine unleashed by Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward policy in 1958 that devastated the farm sector and claimed millions of lives.
